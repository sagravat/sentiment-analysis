After living with seizures for more than 30 years, Alan C. refused to settle any longer. By this time, his condition had affected his life in many ways, including contributing to the demise of his first marriage. In 2005, Alan sought out the help of a neurologist who specialized in epilepsy.

The doctor was amazed when he heard Alan’s medical history and all that he had accomplished despite experiencing monthly tonic-clonic seizures and frequent partial-onset seizures. The doctor made finding an effective treatment for Alan’s tonic-clonic seizures his top priority.

When a new drug treatment became available, he recommended it to Alan. It worked. And what’s more, for the first time in decades, Alan found a treatment that didn’t have debilitating side effects.

Working with his doctor, Alan was able to continue improving his seizure control. A few years later, his doctor prescribed an add-on medication that targeted Alan’s partial-onset seizures. Today, Alan’s seizures are controlled. He’s retired and dedicates his free time to encouraging other people with epilepsy to keep striving for maximum control with minimum side effects.

After graduating from college, Alan C. married his sweetheart. Unfortunately, his continuing tonic-clonic and partial-onset seizures affected every aspect of his life, including his relationships.

He had hoped that married life would create a sense of stability, but it was not to be. His wife had difficulty understanding the true implications of living with uncontrolled seizures. They did the best they could as a couple and as parents, but the specter of epilepsy continued to inhibit their lives.

When his marriage ended 18 years later, Alan was devastated. He felt he had lost everything he’d worked so hard for all his life. At his lowest point, he even lost the hopeful outlook that had sustained him over his journey with epilepsy.

Alan was down, but not out. He was about to meet two people who would help him turn his life around: his second wife and a neurologist who specialized in treating epilepsy.

In college Alan C. did his best to stay awake. The medication that he was taking for his partial-onset seizures caused extreme drowsiness. He referred to it as “the sleeping pill.” Alan’s solution was the same as that of many people with epilepsy who have unacceptable medical side effects: He stopped taking his meds.

Throughout college, Alan experienced tonic-clonic seizures at night as well as partial-onset seizures every day. Despite the physical and emotional toll the seizures had on him, he managed to stay in school and received his math degree.

After graduating, he began teaching high school, but his seizures interfered with his ability to focus. Often he’d have an aura and would have to excuse himself. He’d remain in the hallway until the seizure ran its course. Alan pushed on, but he knew he needed better seizure control to reach his goals.

Alan C. had his first partial-onset seizure when he was just eight years old. He didn’t know what was happening to him and was afraid to tell anyone. Five years later, when he was diagnosed with epilepsy, the neurologist advised his parents to deter him from sports and other strenuous activity.

To Alan who loved the outdoors and playing baseball, this was crushing news. He thought he’d have to give up doing all the things he loved. 

But his parents didn’t see it that way. On the ride home from the doctor’s office, Alan’s father asked him if he still wanted to play ball. “It’s gonna be tougher,” Alan’s father said. “But you can do it, and we’ll support you.” This was remarkable at the time, of course, because in 1956 there was very little information about epilepsy and very few effective treatments.

Decades later, his father’s can-do attitude continues to inspire Alan as he helps others overcome the challenges of epilepsy.

In college Alan C. did his best to stay awake. The medication that he was taking for his partial-onset seizures caused extreme drowsiness. He referred to it as “the sleeping pill.” Alan’s solution was the same as that of many people with epilepsy who have unacceptable medical side effects: He stopped taking his meds.

Throughout college, Alan experienced tonic-clonic seizures at night as well as partial-onset seizures every day. Despite the physical and emotional toll the seizures had on him, he managed to stay in school and received his math degree.

After graduating, he began teaching high school, but his seizures interfered with his ability to focus. Often he’d have an aura and would have to excuse himself. He’d remain in the hallway until the seizure ran its course. Alan pushed on, but he knew he needed better seizure control to reach his goals.

"201","126245912663","Epilepsy Advocate","Alan’s Journey: The Early Years (Part 1)
Alan C. had his first partial-onset seizure when he was just eight years old. He didn’t know what was happening to him and was afraid to tell anyone. Five years later, when he was diagnosed with epilepsy, the neurologist advised his parents to deter him from sports and other strenuous activity.

To Alan who loved the outdoors and playing baseball, this was crushing news. He thought he’d have to give up doing all the things he loved. 

But his parents didn’t see it that way. On the ride home from the doctor’s office, Alan’s father asked him if he still wanted to play ball. “It’s gonna be tougher,” Alan’s father said. “But you can do it, and we’ll support you.” This was remarkable at the time, of course, because in 1956 there was very little information about epilepsy and very few effective treatments.

Decades later, his father’s can-do attitude continues to inspire Alan as he helps others overcome the challenges of epilepsy.

"209","126245912663","Epilepsy Advocate","Chris on the importance of relationships: I can’t stress enough the importance of having a plan of action when visiting your doctor. If you don’t plan ahead about what you are going to ask your doctor, you will likely forget everything the minute your physician walks in the door. My personal advice is to always write your questions down ahead of time and work out a plan of action. When possible, I also recommend having a friend or family member go with you to the doctor’s office. I can’t tell you enough how helpful it has been to have a second pair of ears in that office with me to hear what I should be doing next. 

Additionally, I recommend you go into your appointments with the mindset that ‘the doctor is my friend’ and that you both have a shared goal in your personal health. Keeping that positive mindset and setting the expectation with your doctor, makes for a constructive relationship.

With all the being said, if you don’t feel like your doctor is providing you with the level of help/care that you need, then you should take the opportunity to switch physicians. I have many friends who are getting better care now that they’ve found the right doctor for them. Make sure you find a doctor that shares that same goal with you from the start: to find you the best possible care in managing your seizures.","2014-10-27T17:40:10+0000","photo","https://www.facebook.com/epilepsyadvocate/photos/a.10150442556527664.424692.126245912663/10152893843732664/?type=1","126245912663_10152893844182664",32,2,3
"210","126245912663","Epilepsy Advocate","Our next question comes from Gillian W: “I haven't fully given up but feel discouraged since I have a seizure alert dog to keep me safe since I have seizures daily, and that shows I have at least some type of disability at job interviews and everywhere. If only I could find a job where they aren't afraid about liability or where my service dog doesn't interfere in some way. Any suggestions?”

This is a tough question to answer because my recommendation could be difficult. I see this as an opportunity to shift the conversation from “why my epilepsy won’t prevent me from doing this job” to “I’m going to do the best job of anyone applying…and I happen to have epilepsy!” Having your dog with you can be a badge of honor for how well this company works with people from all backgrounds and all situations! Good companies these days are always looking for talented and diverse workers and having your seizure dog with you is a great way to have a very positive conversation with a potential employer. 

Additionally, you may be able to work with your seizure dog provider to identify potential employers in your area that they already know are amenable to having dogs in the workplace. Additionally, they may be able to provide assistance in general with getting to know potential employers in your area.

Though I didn’t fully understand what was happening at the time, I was experiencing seizures. I was 35 years old when I was officially diagnosed with epilepsy.

It was at that point that they were able to diagnose me with epilepsy. 

At the time, I didn’t fully understand what that really meant. It took me several months to fully comprehend what this meant for me at the time and what it was going to mean for me going forward.

Emotionally and physically, I don’t think I was ready for it. 

The other leaders of my business sat and met with my neurologist (with my full permission) to discuss my readiness to return. I highly recommend being open with co-workers and, in this case, partners and giving them the opportunity to meet with your physician and care team. My view is that we are a team with shared goals, and I wanted them to feel comfortable with my return to the workplace.

Everyone around me was working overtime to try and bring me up to speed and I worked with a host of friends and family as well as professionals. The key hurdle was getting past early feelings of denial of my epilepsy and moving into the next phase of personal re-training. In particular, moving beyond my own personal stubbornness and feeling of ""I can do this on my own"" and making the decision to work with a speech therapist to relearn how to learn and live again.

After suffering brain damage that caused his epilepsy, Chris M. struggled to relearn basic tasks. He couldn’t spell or recall the names of his beloved sons—let alone members of the congregation where he was pastor. The once self-reliant man who guided others now had to ask for help. It wasn’t easy.

Chris became depressed. He mourned the loss of his old life, of his former self, and started to experience extreme emotional outbursts. He felt helpless and alone. Finally he told his neurologist about his mood swings and other emotions he’d been experiencing at that time.

Chris realized that if he wanted the best possible outcome, he would have to become his own advocate. So he began to take a more active role in his treatment. He was not going to settle for life with intolerable side effects. He was going to ask for what he wanted. This became a turning point in his epilepsy journey.

Chris M. was 36 years old and at the height of his career. He was pastor of a large Orlando church. He had married his college sweetheart, Debbie, and they had three very active sons. Life
was good. As a scholar and an accomplished public speaker, Chris wrote his sermons, then memorized every word. He never needed a cue card or prompt. He prided himself on knowing the name of
every member of his congregation by heart.

Then one day, his life changed. Without warning, Chris became seriously ill. Debbie rushed him to the nearest hospital emergency room. As his fever spiked over 100 degrees, his doctors delivered a grim prognosis: Chris had a severe case of encephalitis, and they weren’t sure he would survive the night.

Miraculously, Chris pulled through. But he awoke a changed man. When he began having seizures, his doctors confirmed that he had suffered brain damage and now had epilepsy.

In 2006, Chris M. went through yet another life change. His seizures were under control, but he realized the stress of managing a large congregation was taking its toll. Once again, Chris turned a difficult situation into an opportunity.

Chris was offered the position of campus pastor and spiritual life director at the very campus where he had attended college decades before. Although reluctant to leave the church he had served for 19 years, Chris knew the campus position would allow him to better manage his time. He would also be free to spend more time writing as well as sharing his story as an Epilepsy Advocate. He accepted.

Chris’ epilepsy journey taught him to find the good in his own life experience and help others see beyond challenges to embrace the beauty in life. Through his work as a pastor, motivational speaker, writer and outspoken advocate, Chris continues to inspire others to face adversity and never give up.

So Chris M. would have optimal seizure control with the fewest side effects, his neurologist changed his antiepilepsy medications several times. The changes were hard on his body and emotional state, but Chris was determined to find the best treatment.

When a new antiepilepsy drug became available, Chris realized that being among the first to try it might be a way to help other people with epilepsy. His leap of faith paid off. The new medication gave him seizure control and relief from his emotional turmoil.

He began writing about his experiences. His cathartic effort became the basis of a book entitled Changing My Mind. The book is an honest account of his experience with epilepsy.

As Chris shared his story with others, he realized his experience could be of help to those who were also struggling to overcome not only epilepsy but any of life’s difficulties.

After suffering brain damage that caused his epilepsy, Chris M. struggled to relearn basic tasks. He couldn’t spell or recall the names of his beloved sons—let alone members of the congregation where he was pastor. The once self-reliant man who guided others now had to ask for help. It wasn’t easy.

Chris became depressed. He mourned the loss of his old life, of his former self, and started to experience extreme emotional outbursts. He felt helpless and alone. Finally he told his neurologist about his mood swings and other emotions he’d been experiencing at that time.

Chris realized that if he wanted the best possible outcome, he would have to become his own advocate. So he began to take a more active role in his treatment. He was not going to settle for life with intolerable side effects. He was going to ask for what he wanted. This became a turning point in his epilepsy journey.

Chris M. was 36 years old and at the height of his career. He was pastor of a large Orlando church. He had married his college sweetheart, Debbie, and they had three very active sons. Life
was good. As a scholar and an accomplished public speaker, Chris wrote his sermons, then memorized every word. He never needed a cue card or prompt. He prided himself on knowing the name of
every member of his congregation by heart.

Then one day, his life changed. Without warning, Chris became seriously ill. Debbie rushed him to the nearest hospital emergency room. As his fever spiked over 100 degrees, his doctors delivered a grim prognosis: Chris had a severe case of encephalitis, and they weren’t sure he would survive the night.

Miraculously, Chris pulled through. But he awoke a changed man. When he began having seizures, his doctors confirmed that he had suffered brain damage and now had epilepsy.

Jacksonian seizures are a form of partial-onset seizures that start in one part of the body and then spread to other adjacent areas on the same side of the body. 

For example, the seizure may start with the twitch of a thumb, then the hand may jerk, followed by spread up the arm and then to the face… and it can ultimately progress to a tonic-clonic seizure.","2014-02-04T14:46:58+0000","photo","https://www.facebook.com/epilepsyadvocate/photos/a.10150442556527664.424692.126245912663/10152284838067664/?type=1","126245912663_10152284842412664",138,9,83
