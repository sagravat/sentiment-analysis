It is a major handicap that many people don't understand because it is not visible. Even if it is controlled with medication it does not matter. Having epilepsy when I was younger, and they didn't know what was wrong with me, it was hell for me as a child growing up. It made my already teased, and bullied, struggle to learn situation so much worse. I made it, but there is some irreversible damage, and problems that I have to overcome everyday. I am happy that they know more about epilepsy nowadays, thanks to groups like this, and medical research. It is better that everyone can get a better chance at the development, of social skills, mental, and emotional skills, and education, that we all deserve.","2015-08-22T18:43:31+0000",0,"10153658881302664_10153659536287664"

They went to a four day work week and we worked 6:00 a.m. to  4:30 p.m.  Now you would think that wouldn't make much difference.  I had a seizure every day for weeks before my boss let me go back to the old schedule.  (Some other people never switched)  Good thing I don't have seizures any more, because now that old schedule isn't an option.  Pity.  I would rather work that extra day and have shorter days!","2015-08-06T18:50:03+0000",0,"10153616511422664_10153619309487664"

"156","10202873353576683","Brenda Johnson","My heart goes out to all who suffer from this condition/disorder as my son and husband both had seizures.  I lost my son when he suffered a seizure on Easter Sunday, April 12, 2009 and died of asphyxiation.  My husbands seizures however did not take him from me, he died of brain cancer in the motor cortex as well as other places.  The most important thing i found out regarding epilepsy is that the patients need to be diligent about taking meds and that they need the right doctor with continuity of care.  Over the 40 years of our marriage my husband would decide he didn't need his meds and we would have episodes of status epilepsy.  He did this early in our marriage but go better because I was relentless about making sure he had his meds.  When our loved ones are having seizures we have to be advocates for them both in hospitals and with doctors because they can't speak for themselves.  They need to see doctors who are especially trained in epilepsy.  My husbands seizures were so bad that we finally got him in to see an epileptologist at Duke University and he prescribed medicine for him that I would administer to him if he started having one seizure after another so that we did not have to make a trip to an ER.  Going to ER always made things worse because the doctors would change his meds and it could take months to gain back the ground we had lost.  My son was a different story as he was very noncompliant in taking his meds and he was also bipolar and had hemophilia.  He was his own worst enemy when it came to his conditions but he was a grown man and as a mother there was only so much I could do to help him especially after the government put rules in place that prevented parents from having access to medical information on their children once the reached puberty.  When patients are having seizures they cannot communicate with medical personnel therefore for those of you who have children or a significant other you ned to make sure that someone has healthcare power of attorney in these type situations or your hands are tied. If things are not available in hospitals that are essential for diagnosis and treatment of your loved ones take them to a facility that has the proper equipment.  You loved ones can't fight for themselves so you have to do it for them.  If i can be of assistance for any of you please feel free to contact me.  It took me 40 years to learn what I know about epilepsy and treatment and i am happy to share what I know if it will help even one person or one parent from losing a child as I lost mine.  Praying for all.  May God bless you all.","2015-08-05T12:46:31+0000",4,"10153614271767664_10153616128182664"

"296","10154043803355328","Todd Morse","It enhanced my depression, finding the right meds became demanding, I had just been promoted when I first started getting them. The meds screwed up my head pretty badly. I had to re-learn how to work in the corporate world. I went from a nearly photographic memory to being unable to remember what was said to my face after I walked away. The stress of changing my life, because it was so much harder, just made everything get worse. I have serious depression as well and the combination has made me a different person. I am angry, I am sad, I am hurt and always feel broken. My seizures are controlled by a nice expensive cocktail of meds, but I eventually have a breakthrough seizure then have to work from there. 
I started making bad choices and feeling like I wasn't myself. It caused me to leave one stressful, but familiar, job for a different stressful job, which I ended up walking out on. I got three more good jobs after that, but was treated differently in every one of them once I had a seizure in the office. I was treated with kid gloves, but in a completely biased way. I was looked over for promotions, I became the black sheep or the problem child. I did work equal to or better than my teammates but it wasn't relevant.
I had friends, and I literally have none. I hurt emotionally and physically every day. I spent five months job searching,  interviewing, writing cover letters and changing my resume and thank you notes only to come up completely dry. My depression is dark and vicious and I have another cocktail of meds for that. Then I take concentration meds because I'm so tired, and I take pain meds because my body hurts every day.
I was fun, funny, athletic, likeable, nice, and good-hearted. Now I'm just not. I used to play volleyball with friends and then at some point I just wasn't on the team anymore. Same with basketball. And happy hours. And sitting with a group of friends with season tickets for football games. And stopped being asked to go to things. Etc.

So other than losing jobs, changing my speech patterns, adding very dark, negative thoughts into my everyday life, gaining 135 lbs, changing how I feel, keeping me in constant vigilance, disrupting the plans of my retired parents, alienating me from friends and colleagues, adding fear to my son and wife if I make a strange noise or breathe funny, feeling judged and discriminated against often, feeling insecure personally, causing me pain, making me a worse person with less ideals and hopes to being judgmental, angry, and mouthy, it hasn't impacted me or my relationships in any way.

Dealt with looks when he seized in public but never a helping hand. Remarks from his coworkers calling him names like retard. Or people refusing to be next to him. He underwent many studies, test etc. To determine where the seizures are coming from. He had surgery in December 2014, new year's Eve..we, I thought finally, a new year a new start for our lives. Didn't work. Still seizing, all grand mal, we don't have any warning of when they will come and like you I deal with his state afterwards. He can't work either. And because of his condition, there are many simple things we take for granted I can't have him do. He is going through occupational, speech and physical therapy once a week.

Having gone through breast cancer and the many failed reconstruction surgeries, chemo, septic infections (which is thought is what caused my epilepsy), all of it was easy compared to what has come from having epilepsy.  People treat you like you are crazy, made it up - you name it.  I mentioned in another post, I even had an ER room kick me out, after arriving by ambulance, from a drop seizure that left me unable to walk or control my left side.  But, with it, has come many awakenings.    My politics, my views on law enforcement, pretty much everything changed after one too many abuses - inflicted on me and seeing others (like kids and dogs) go through it.  Mine are not under control either.  Working has gone from professional to little cleaning jobs and stuff (also awakened me to how many of these people are treated).

A HOSPITAL... the medics wrapped my burned body in a bath towel!!! So, I had to be put in a tub of ice.. Then, grafting surgery.. I was 27!!! Spent the next ten years being called a Retard, freak... Losing job after job.. And.. My Dr's. Spending less than 15mns with me, every six months.. Blaming my onset on my Female hormones... And, doping me up on meds... A client for years, helped get me in for tests at the MAYO... One hour there and meeting my doctor.. He told me I had a brain tumor, non-cancerous and BRAIN SURGERY was the answer... WOW!!! 9 Nerologists, 7 MRI's, and 32 medications... And.. I was probably born with this!!! The MAYO was blown away... I had surgery ten years ago this past week.. And, have only had two seizures in the past ten years... BUT, that label has stuck with me.. Because Now, I have side effects of the chuck of my brain they removed... I was very fortunate... I do my best to go on.. Pay the gift my customer gave me forward... And... Would like to tell the world my story, because of the label, Sigma, etc.. That continues... I was lucky to have met Coach Jerry Kill a year ago (MN golfers coach with Epilepsy) told him he was my Hero... I pray that social media can help prove that those with Seizures & Eplipsey are VERY capable of living life.. Coach Kill is a shinning example (college educated, great coach) and he is working with my local Epilepsy foundation to help pass along this label is unfounded... <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+0082> I was blessed at my Worst... And, I just want to tell the world that to help others that face the challenges of daily life... With this.. Not to be so quick to judge!!

When I had brain surgery, when I woke up from it, I didn't know anything, anyone, who I was, I didn't know a word of english, I didn't even know how to move my arms and legs. Luckily over the years much has come back to my memory but not all of it. I have forgot many things like I did in my past. Especially the good things. I went through high school only knowing the words yes and no. While having on average 3-5 grand mals a week. I would wake up with pee and sometimes poop all over me in the middle of the hallways.

Whenever y'all are put on a New Medication; If those New Medications have a Negative Effect Then Tell them that 1 Medication is Counteracting 1 or the Other Medications; then They'll be able to Find Out Which One's they are. Some Of Our can be Controlled w/Work, & Other's Controlled by Certain Temperature Ranges. Your Prescription Vials/Labels will say which Medications can handle what kind of temperatures they can Handle. So if y'all live in an Environment where it's Warmer than Cold: Then you'll want a Rx that will  keep you from Sweating to Death; or If you Live in a Colder Climate; Than you'll want an Rx that will keep you from Freezing to Death.","2015-03-31T05:27:47+0000",0,"10153283075067664_10153284530637664"

What I see here are people who are afraid to live and choose to use their epilepsy as an excuse to not do so. People who are not epileptic have vehicle accidents every day and it is usually due to carelessness. Risks are a natural part of life and driving a vehicle for anyone is a risky thing. Yes you should take precautions to avoid the possible negative effects of risky behavior, but taking risks in life are necessary, if you avoid taking risks, you fail to live life to it's fullest. If you marry some one, you take the risk that that marriage might fail, but you will never know unless you take the risk, come what may.

I get frequent migraines, my vision isnt the same so it makes them worse, i cant concentrate, and the memory loss is no help at all. Is your son having issues in school? Maybe you should consider it as a sign. If not sit down and talk to him. I think it's  great that you follow this page, and trying to learn more. It is very difficult  to have to accept that this is our life. The headaches, losing  careers, and not remembering the most important event in our lives.

Then the doctors,after 72 hour EEG in hospital stay,inwhich she did not have a single seizure,lol,go figure. The long term insurance company which was paying her long term leave pay cut her checks off immediately. Reason was the doctors found nothing wrong during her stay. She has little seizure meds left,and we cannot afford almost a $1,000.00 a month. This just causes more stress and ofcource more seizures. Without some kind of help from somewhere,her condition is only worsening. She was getting scheduled by her primary doctor to go to the Mayo Clinic,but with no insurance and no income things are not looking to good. She has multiple seizures back to back,and it's not good. Since January 1st,she has had episodes daily,but in that time she has had 5 days that she was seizure free,a Blessing. I have been writing done her episodes on paper,but who in the long pays for her condition is her. She has been having seizures since age 12,the last 2 years have been ridiculous.

They did not start until I was 18 yrs old.  I had been having déjà vu for as long as I can remember, but thought everyone had that.  One night I woke up in a complex type seizure.  My parents took me to the hospital where I had a grand mal seizure.  It took a month or more to mentally get back to normal.  No doctor has ever been successful at controlling mine.  Most months if I am going to have one, it will happen two weeks prior to my menstrual cycle begins.  I had a simple partial seizure two days ago right after exercising.  My memory is effected by my seizure.  Sometimes it takes days to be back to normal and sometimes it only hours.  I am a teacher with a Masters Degree in School Counseling.  It is by God's grace that I have mentally been able to accomplish what I have.  The seizures are very frustrating for me.  I do not like not being able to remember things.  No one seems to understand.  I have to work EXTRA hard to compensate for it.  I just take it a day at a time.

Thankfully, my first accident only involved me and my car.  I actually injured - thank the Lord not seriously - a person in the second accident, went for several years without driving, then started back up again.  At a regularly scheduled appointment, the neurologist saw me dig my car keys out of my pocket as I was leaving his office.  He gave me until the end of the next business day, to turn my license in to the DMV, or he would report me - and he made good on that promise.  I was FURIOUS at the time, but have been thankful ever since.  My son is a fire fighter/paramedic, and has told me some real horror stories of accidents he's seen that were caused by people with epilepsy, in which they or someone they hit was seriously injured or killed, because the patient, whose seizures weren't 100% controlled, continued to drive either without a license, or they had never told anyone they had epilepsy, and still had their license.   With help from family, friends, and the local bus, I can get anywhere I need to go.  It's just not worth the risk.  Even as a bus passenger one time, I got off the bus just as one of my complex-partial seizures began.

"1543","901316919912599","Tim Mullen","Just A Dog ?

For all of my animal lover friends....

From time to time, people tell me, ""lighten up, it’s just a dog,"" or, ""that’s a lot of money for ""just a dog"".

They don’t understand all the generous people involved,  the distance traveled, the time spent, the hours of training.  Or the costs involved for ""just a dog"".

Tim, you are stupid for paying that much money for ""just a dog"". As Garth saves my life the first week I had ""just a dog"".

Some of my proudest moments have come about with ""just a dog"".After all of you made it possible for me to have"" just a dog ""and all he has done for me I figured it was time to give back, if ""just a dog"" could bring me so much happiness then why not spread the love! So we visit the Children's hospital and visit with otherwise lonely sienor citizens.  It just makes me happy to see a sick child or lonely sienor get the same joy that I get from ""just a dog""! 

Many hours have passed and my only company was ""just a dog,"" because I can now be left alone again so my fiance can work, and have her independence back!  But I did not once feel slighted or afraid being left alone with ""just a dog"".

Some of my saddest moments have been brought about by ""just a dog,"" and in those days of darkness, the gentle touch of ""just a dog"" gave me comfort and reason to overcome the day.Or waking up in the ICU units with ""just a dog"" between my legs quiet and waiting only to check on me! ""Just a dog"" has never complained, a true loyalty I cannot explain! 

If you, too, think it’s ""just a dog,"" then you will probably understand phrases like ""just a friend,"" ""just a sunrise,"" or ""just a promise"".

""Just a dog"" brings into my life the very essence of friendship, trust, and pure unbridled joy. And now independence and Garth <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B0><U+0095> makes it possible to do things that you all take for granted like driving and feeling safe alone, knowing Garth <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B0><U+0095> will alert or call help if I seize.

""Just a dog"" brings out the compassion and patience that make me a better person.

Because of ""just a dog"", I will rise early, take long walks and look longingly to the future. Now I can go anywhere with ""just a dog"" and am comfortable that when the time arises, ""just a dog"" will do what all those hours of training taught ""just a dog"" to do!

So for me and folks like me, it’s not ""just a dog"" but an embodiment of all the hopes and dreams of the future, the fond memories of the past, and the pure joy of the moment.

""Just a dog"" brings out what’s good in me and diverts my thoughts away from myself and the worries of the day.

I hope that someday they can understand that it’s not ""just a dog"", but the thing that gives me humanity, independence and keeps me from being ""just a man"".

So the next time you hear the phrase ""just a dog"" just smile... because they ""just don’t understand
  Right Garth <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B0><U+0095>","2015-01-26T02:52:34+0000",2,"10153125336672664_10153126704102664"

Until I was on a plane home, and happen to be seated next to a top Neurologist that had a new medication, that was just right for me? My Neurologist allowed me to take it. It was and has been great. The most important thing I have listened to God's word for me, is to eat well. I ate peanut butter every night. I found foods that I am allergic to THAT being one. It closed my throat,  and caused many of the problems. Another is anti- fungal diet and medication. No white bread, yeast or sugar. This was a cause of low blood sugar. That is a main cause of MY EPILEPSY. I still take medication and always will. Finding a better way to eat, and let God bring you through this,  is the Way. :) I too was in an accident due to not eating.

I lost all of my independence and began having to rely on others to help me get around. May 2015 will be one year since i have suffered a grand mal seizure. I began seeing a new neurologist a few weeks ago to hopefully be able to start driving again. All i have been dealing with is some sleep issues (sleep walking mainly) since my one yr old son was born. This neurologist ordered an eeg and a sleep study for me. I did my eeg last week and to my surprise, it came back very abnormal. My doctor told me i am suffering from silent seizures and have at least ten or more an hour. This was a huge slap in the face. All this time when i thought i was getting better, i have actually been getting worse. Who knows when i will ever be able to drive or if i will ever be able to drive again. I am just ready to have my life back and be able to take my kids anywhere they need to go without having to make sure it doesnt interfere with anyone elses schedule. It just seems so unfair. Im staying positive as best i can and am searching for an online support group. I refuse to let this illness slip me into a deep depression as it has done in the past. If anyone has any advice for me to point me in the direction of others who also deal with this, it would be greatly appreciated. My doctor increased and added more meds to stabilize the seizures but its up to me of course to not allow this to affect me emotionally. I am just ready to have my life back 100 percent. I want it for my children more than anything.","2015-01-25T18:50:44+0000",1,"10153113016727664_10153125838172664"

"1655","10203431048195362","Chris Arceneaux","A simple partial seizure that only affects your senses is called an aura. 

AURAS

The part of your brain where your seizures originate (your seizure focal point) also may be linked to a specific type of aura because an aura represents the beginning of a seizure. Since different parts of the brain are responsible for different things, the warning signs you experience will be related to the functions of the section of brain where the seizure is about to occur. People whose seizures begin in the temporal lobe tend to have certain types of auras and those whose seizures begin somewhere else often will have different types. 

Here are some types of auras that can happen alone or in combinations…

Visual changes

Kaleidoscope effects, Visual hallucinations, Shimmering sensations, Vibrating visual field, Distortions in size, shape or distance of objects, Bright lights or blobs, Zigzag lines, Tunnel vision, Blind or dark spots in the field of vision, Curtain-like effect over one eye, Blindness in one eye, Motionless stare, Dilated pupils,

Auditory changes

Hallucinations — hearing voices or sounds that don’t exist, Being unable to understand spoken words, Muffled sounds, Buzzing noises, Loud or whispered volume, Temporary deafness

Physical changes

Weakness, unsteadiness, Changes in heart rate, Sweating, Nausea, Vertigo, Saliva collecting in mouth, Lip smacking, Chewing, Swallowing, Strange smells, Problems speaking, Repetitive movements, Limbs jerking involuntarily, Numbness or tingling on one side of face or body, Feeling of being separated from your body, Needing to urinate

Psychological changes

Confusion, Anxiety or fear, Physical detachment, Déjà vu or Jamais vu, a sense of familiarity or unfamiliarity","2015-01-21T15:07:47+0000",1,"10153108845577664_10153117070962664"

His whole body will stiffen up and shake like with a grand mal but he can speak. He will cry and yell mom over and over until I get by his side. Then he just cries until it is done. Before a seizer happens his right leg will go numb and within 24 hours he will have one. Then immediately after and for about 5-10 minutes his right leg will be numb and he will be unable to move it or stand. When he has a seizer, he will normally have at least two within an hour of each other, but not always.

When you've been diagnosed with epilepsy seizures can happen at any time. No matter how long you've been seizure free. So, no matter if it's been a year or 6 months of a waiting period.  I believe this is a matter between patients and their doctors. Because not all seizures are alike nor are there impacts the same on each person. Again as I stated, most ppl don't joy ride I think unfortunately, some ppl may drive because they don't have any other choice. It's just my opinion.

I was Diagnosed when I was 18yrs just like my mom. Grand-mal seizures and diagnosed as genetic. Here is what I have noticed with myself and wonder if this can help anyone else that may be born with this disease naturally. I am 36 now and must had a baby a year ago.
Here are some factors or things I have noticed. 
1. Hormonally related. Around my period cycle I get (what I call) seizure activity. My mother told me the doctors show on bt had a big debate about new talk about hormones. For me, this is a connection 100%.  I went on birth control (nuvaring since they don't have to up the dose of estrogen in that one). And I felt better!!! Being pregnant I had never felt better in my life and this includes of days of NO SLEEP which normally is a huge trigger for me! 
2. STRESS AND SLEEP is always a factor and always will be. I do my best to control and stay happy with Activities I enjoy, relaxing a lot and making sure I get plenty of sleep. 
3. DIET! CARBS!!!! Carbs are always told its a NO NO bc it makes you fat. WRONG. Your brain cannot function properly without carbs. Anabolic is the term used when your body is starved of these. Don't forget your brain needs these! Make sure your morning has them and keep them consistent through your daily meals!  I have felt seizure activity when I am low. Fast metabolism ppl really need to be careful. 
4. You all know alcohol is a bad idea. It's when the brain comes down from the buzz that you ""detox"" from the substance and that's when  you are seizure prone. 
Please feel free to contact me for more information on remedies you can do yourself to help. I won't clog up this post with a book lol. I hope this has helped anymore. God bless and stay safe everyone!!","2015-01-10T18:08:47+0000",3,"10153088487857664_10153092969632664"

Afterwards, I was told that I started making hiccup-like noises, got up, walked around the classroom, out the back door, walked around the building, and back into the main lobby where I sat down and recovered from the seizure.

I was Diagnosed when I was 18yrs just like my mom. Grand-mal seizures and diagnosed as genetic. Here is what I have noticed with myself and wonder if this can help anyone else that may be born with this disease naturally. I am 36 now and must had a baby a year ago.
Here are some factors or things I have noticed. 
1. Hormonally related. Around my period cycle I get (what I call) seizure activity. My mother told me the doctors show on bt had a big debate about new talk about hormones. For me, this is a connection 100%.  I went on birth control (nuvaring since they don't have to up the dose of estrogen in that one). And I felt better!!! Being pregnant I had never felt better in my life and this includes of days of NO SLEEP which normally is a huge trigger for me! 
2. STRESS AND SLEEP is always a factor and always will be. I do my best to control and stay happy with Activities I enjoy, relaxing a lot and making sure I get plenty of sleep. 
3. DIET! CARBS!!!! Carbs are always told its a NO NO bc it makes you fat. WRONG. Your brain cannot function properly without carbs. Anabolic is the term used when your body is starved of these. Don't forget your brain needs these! Make sure your morning has them and keep them consistent through your daily meals!  I have felt seizure activity when I am low. Fast metabolism ppl really need to be careful. 
4. You all know alcohol is a bad idea. It's when the brain comes down from the buzz that you ""detox"" from the substance and that's when  you are seizure prone. 
Please feel free to contact me for more information on remedies you can do yourself to help. I won't clog up this post with a book lol. I hope this has helped anymore. God bless and stay safe everyone!!","2015-01-10T18:08:07+0000",0,"10153002824487664_10153092968507664"

When he finally did, we got into see his PCP who set him up with a neurologist right away.  These ""moments"" stopped three days before we saw her, but he started on medication for the next 10 months, which depressed him horribly,  so when fall hit and he wasn't getting outside as much the depression got worse, he told his PCP that he had feelings of not wanting to live if this is how he was going to feel. So we saw his neurologist three months before the year was up being on that med, she weaned him off of it before we saw her. He was not having any of those ""moments"" at all since taking the meds, but without them, or some meds, there was always the chance of having another, and, perhaps having an accident.  That was enough for him to agree to continue taking some kind of meds for the possiblity.  Before meeting with the neuroologiest hubby did have an MRI which showed that on one side of his hippocampus near the base, there was an enlargement.  He will have another MRI in Feb to see if there is a change.  I asked her point blank if she saw any signs of Alzheimers and she said, not at this time, but if soemthing else, it is a very difficult area to remove something.

I was having seizures at least once a month up till I was 25. I also had three grand mal seizures in that 10 year timespan. In 2005 I had a grand mal seizure that landed me in ICU for three days, and in the hospital for a a total of a week. Because of these seizures and state laws, I was not able to get my license to drive. People were telling me that I needed to get used to the fact that I may not ever be able to drive. But, I kept telling them that I would drive some day. To make an already log story short, In 2006 I finally got my drivers license. Also, I have not had a seizure since 2005, and  am not currently taking medication for it.

I just want people to know that you can overcome. Don’t let anyone tell you cannot do something because you have epilepsy. Epilepsy is something we have, not who we are.","2014-11-30T18:59:42+0000",20,"10152966748937664_10152966805352664"

I just took the tv out of my bedroom so it's not a temptation to watch late at night or just too much in general. I also wear a night mask over my eyes so I don't wake up to light. If I'm traveling and there's noise outside that's keeping me up I will listen to my ""sleep songs"" playlist on my iPod (a HUGE lifesaver).

I have been diagnosed with epilepsy and have been disabled from law enforcement since 2008 and I have two daughters currently on meds for epilepsy. My oldest daughter was hired on at Walmart as a cashier in July 2014 with them full aware of her epilepsy. During this time on occasions her memory would come and go in which they were aware. Being as a cashier she had issues with remembering to put cash back in the drawer or be in the middle of getting change for her register and would forget leaving the money on top and without honestly thinking walk away from the register doing other things her job requires. They gave a verbal warning and a written warning and both time she explained she ""zones out"" at times and forgets. Well instead of moving her to another position in the store they want her to come in tomorrow and fire her for the same thing that happened to take place Saturday night. I don't know what to do. I don't know if there are discrimination things taking place due to her disability. If anyone can help or point me in the right direction I live in Arkansas.  My number is 870 250 0878.

I don’t think there’s any way we can’t say that the world needs to be more aware of Epilepsy – we just can’t say it enough! I’m retired now and I spend a lot of time speaking with individual families and schools – basically anyone saying “I need a mentor – someone who has been here and lived through this.” When I was a young teenager, I would have given ANYTHING to have met someone that could give me guidance who knew what I was going through – but I didn’t get that until I was in my forties. That personal connection is so important. So I’m hoping today to be that resource for people going through what I went through.","2014-11-24T17:10:26+0000",8,"10152953345857664_10152953455652664"
"2550","126245912663","Epilepsy Advocate","Once you’ve reached Acceptance, you’re going to start asking yourself: “What are the things I can do to tell if I’m getting better or getting worse?” So I usually say: “If you don’t play to win, why keep score?” While this isn’t a game, we still want to win – so it’s important that we keep score! So what does that mean?

You MUST keep records of your seizure activity. Whether it’s daily or weekly, you need to find some way to keep records of: frequency, severity (how tough), time of day (asleep or awake), and any additional triggers – for me, I track relative stress level (for example, somewhere between 1 and 10).  You need to do one additional thing: it’s important that you can find a way to SUMMARIZE this at a level that is easily understandable by your physician. In my case, I’ve done it at monthly or quarterly levels (though I usually do monthly at this time). In these summarizations, you need to point out any particular changes you’ve had in your personal lifestyle (career changes, stressors, treatment changes, etc) so that you can see patterns that correlate to the activities around you. 

In this picture, you can see an example of a chart I’ve created over the years to share with my physician.","2014-11-24T18:09:31+0000",4,"10152953345857664_10152953566362664"
"2551","126245912663","Epilepsy Advocate","Our first question of the day is from Lisa-Marie W: “How do you explain epilepsy/ prepare your students for a possible seizure during the term?”

I first taught in a very rural area in Missouri in the mid 70s, so there was very little information or awareness of epilepsy. I actually never stood up in front of my students and told them “I have epilepsy” – the awareness just wasn’t there. I didn’t want to tell my students because I knew A) they wouldn’t understand and B) there was no way for them to really educate themselves about this disease (remember, this was the mid-70s!!). In my case, I would have about a 10 second aura warning. I would just exit the room and have my seizure in the hallway, collect myself, and then re-enter the room and make some excuse. In two years, I never had a student come up to me to ask what was actually wrong – and this happened to me roughly every two weeks for two years. If I did it today, I would certainly sit down first with my students and say “Today we aren’t going to talk about math – we’re going to talk about Epilepsy.” I would want to talk through exactly what epilepsy is and what it means to me. I may even let the students watch me have a partial-onset seizure at some point just so that they could learn and have first-hand knowledge since so few people actually know about epilepsy.","2014-11-24T17:21:48+0000",4,"10152953345857664_10152953477297664"
"2552","126245912663","Epilepsy Advocate","When I speak with patients across the country, I like to focus on 5 important factors: 
-	Acceptance
-	Keeping Score
-	Predicting
-	Playing by the Rules
-	Should I give up?

I’ll touch on Acceptance first. It doesn’t matter if you’ve been recently diagnosed or were diagnosed 10 years ago, at some point you’ll go through the 5 stages of grief: Denial, Anger, Bargaining, Depression, and finally Acceptance. Throughout the first 3 stages, your seizures are still there; and when you move into depression (which you will likely do), your body may respond with increased seizure activity purely as a factor of enhanced stress. 

Until you finally Accept the fact that you have Epilepsy, then (in my opinion) you’re never going to be able to take charge of the problem yourself and be able to take important steps to correct this. “I accept it; I know I have it; NOW what can I do?”","2014-11-24T17:53:43+0000",3,"10152953345857664_10152953532112664"
"2553","126245912663","Epilepsy Advocate","When I was younger, I played basketball and would have seizures on the court. My coach would burn a time-out and get me off the court. After that, he would check on me throughout the game to see how I was feeling and see when I was ready to go back in. This was the same case for baseball, football, etc. Today, people learn they have epilepsy, then go online and find so much information that it can scare them. In my case, I had people in my life who were willing to sit with me and learn what was happening to me and push me to be better – as opposed to just assuming the worse. 

We ended up discovering exactly what was happening to me when I was in seventh grade: we saw a public service announcement on TV that showed “little Johnny” having a seizure on TV and I said to my mom “that’s exactly what happens to me every day” – from that point on we started doing the research it would take to find a way to make me better! My parents gave me an option: they said, do you want to stop doing these things you’re doing or do you want to work hard? I wanted to keep doing these fun activities that I was doing and the only way to do that was to keep on pushing for better treatment. My parents were true mentors for me – they pushed me to keep finding ways to improve my condition.","2014-11-24T17:37:01+0000",3,"10152953345857664_10152953503837664"

"2559","126245912663","Epilepsy Advocate","Once you’ve started tracking your seizure activity, you can begin to notice important patterns and/or triggers. For me, stress is a major trigger. My normal stress level is at a 5 – if I’m sitting at that normal stress level, my seizure activity is normal for me. Now, if I suddenly take on new projects and my stress level spikes to an 8 or 9, then my seizure activity wouldn’t change significantly either. This was good. Unfortunately, as soon as my stress level DROPPED (let’s say down to a 2), then my seizure activity would go up significantly. So it wasn’t during a stressful time that seizures happened – it was actually after the stressful periods when it occurred. For instance, when I was playing basketball, my seizures would occur during time outs or during free throws because the stress had stopped. 

So what does that mean for me now? I have learned how to step myself down from my high stress level down to a normal stress level to avoid the large drops that trigger increased seizure activity. I work to keep my stress levels fairly consistent and avoid significant up-and-down swings in stress. This is the pattern I learned about myself by observing my charts and data – it will be different for any of you for sure, but that’s how it works for me.","2014-11-24T18:43:38+0000",2,"10152953345857664_10152953713362664"

I had petimals as a young child in the 70's, when they still called them fits and nobody talked about it. I out grew them, but in 2002, had my first grandmal/tonic clonic seizure. I've always been active and as long as my husband & I took precaution, I started running which then turned into doing triathlons. I just completed a half Ironman. 
My seizures had been under control with 2 medications and with that, have been seizure free since 2006. I did have one, after seeing a 3D movie, but as bad as it was, because I am active, my Neurologist believes I came out of it quicker than years past because of my activities. 
So I encourage those, that if your seizure are under control, then live life. Life is precious and so much to experience.","2014-11-12T01:17:00+0000",1,"10152923162892664_10152926725982664"

 You Can Call Me...

When you're not expecting it,
I can take control
Grasp your mind, thoughts, and body
given enough time, I can pull your heart from your soul.

When you're out and about,
I can make look like a fool
embarrass you outright
Because you are just my tool.

I am always here with you,
And I refuse to leave
I'm right here on your shoulder, 
right on your sleeve.

I can take you anytime,
Yes anytime I want
I can introduce my self at any given moment
My power have I can always flaunt.

I have been called many things,
you can cuss me at your leisure 
Yes, I have many names, 
But you can call me seizure

"3051","10203451369471094","Kari Kuntz","I'm a 38 year old chemical engineering student, mom to the two most perfect and amazing Korat cats, a pretty loving girlfriend, and I have epilepsy. I have the pleasure of only having grand mal seizures, no variety. My first happened completely out of the blue in 2004, and I injured myself pretty badly. They always last at least ten minutes and have been getting longer with each successive one. I have had 14 concussions, broken my nose twice, dislocated both shoulders, broken one wrist so badly that it required surgery, and numerous painful bruises and cuts. I'm blessed that I have an aura of about 1-2 seconds, so a couple of times I've been able to prevent injury from the seizure by getting to the floor, and the one time I had one while driving, I was able to pull over to safety beforehand. Epilepsy has taken a lot from me: my career as a transit driver in Minneapolis, my ability to play video games, seeing live concerts, this intangible and unexplainable feeling of safety and well-being. You never know when or where you'll be when the next one happens, and uncertainty causes stress for me, and stress increases the frequency of the seizures and intensifies the chronic pain I have from the injuries sustained during seizures. Thankfully, I've found a combination of medications that control my seizures really well; I used to have them every few weeks and now I'm approaching my second year free of seizures. They're very expensive: even as generics, the monthly cash price is more than $500. I hate that I have to depend on money from the government (in the form of an insurance subsidy) to be able to buy my medications, I took great pride in being a self-sufficient, tax-paying, productive citizen, and now I'm dependent. I'm afraid that my hard work in engineering school will be a waste, because what if I have a seizure and I'm working in a chemical plant? I've been fortunate and have always lived where doctors are not required to report seizures to the DMV, so I've never lost my license, but will I be legally able to work in the settings that a chemical engineer would work in?

I was in ICU for a month and barely knew who I was, I lost years of memory that will never come back and everyday is hard.  I couldnt read, write, walk, and now I have become a certified Yoga teacher.  I will not stop fighting.  I have done charity evnts for the past 4 yrs, I do have a facebook page and website that I havent updated recently but its called ""journeyforfaith"" My name.  My mom said in the hospital, I guess I named her for a reason.  I am on 3-4 medicines and had a VNS put in.  Still not working.  I am going up to NY in the next few mth for tests and then to have surgery, others are scared....me....just get me on the table. You dont walk in my shoes.  Each seizure just makes you feel bad physically and emotionally.  I wont let epilepsy define me, but its been a rough month... Im just not doing great, my Yoga has been a gift and my place I can go to when I just need to be and breathe and let it go.  There is a universe up there, I believe that, not sure why all this happened at the age of 38 but I definitely changed as a person and realize whats important... Got rid of all things toxic... Now its time for me to get better, I have 2 boys, one turning 10 Saturday and the other 12.  They need their mommy....","2014-11-12T04:29:24+0000",0,"10152893851257664_10152927168447664"

We have one son together (14), I have a son (19), and my husband has three - two boys (19 & 17) and a girl (18).  At their ages you can feel them slipping away into adulthood and it is hard sometimes, there will never be enough time in the world to spend with them.  We are total animal lovers with three dogs, one cat, and sixteen birds!!  They are all an extension of our family; some talk, some play, some cuddle, and some have truly been a comfort to me.  I love helping others and felt I had found a my true calling in the medical office field, even got my BA in Health Care Administration with a GPA I never expected out of myself :-)  My life changed early January 2010 when I had my first grand-mal ever at the age of 32.  Even though I tried so hard not to I lost my job, I lost the independence of driving myself around, and I started to swirl down the rabbit hole of depression.  I still am not medically released to return to work or drive, but I mentally fight allowing epilepsy to define me everyday.  Honestly, it has made me look for my own self worth in places other than work, it has made me appreciate everyday I wake up and don't have my husband stairing scaredly in my eyes, and it has made me more aware of every blessing I am given.

I'm on three right now.  I've had the VNS since September of 2012, and things just seem to be getting worse with my condition.

I had a horrible car accident 4 years ago due to a seizure, & DMV said I'd never be able to drive again, even if I'm seizure free for a year.   It seems that I've lost my best friend, and a lot of friends besides her, b/c I can't drive, and they don't want to take the time to drive a measly 10-15 to come to my house.

I realize now how irresponsible this was, but I kept working (driving) until 2006, when I came clean with my employer. I was hoping to be able to get a different job within the company, but it wasn't so. That's been the only real job I've had, I was there for over ten years. So, I'm having to retrain myself for a whole new career…  but that means going to engineeing school, and an 86 mile one-way commute. Thankfully, I've been seizure-free since January 19, 2013 and my meds keep them controlled, to the point where if I stopped taking my meds, I could predict the next seizure to within hours. I live in New Orleans, in a suburban area with poor bus service, yet it's still too dangerous to be out as a single female. I have a 1-2 second aura before the seizures start, and that has saved me from injuries more than a few times. I'm terrified of what may happen, I know that I won't likely live out my life seizure-free, but I don't know how I'd get anywhere if I can't drive, since my support system is virtually nonexistent.","2014-11-15T02:20:58+0000",0,"10152842693707664_10152932951627664"

I have a unusual case, in that there are two different parts of my brain,  in different areas,  one on either side of my brain.  I am also struggling with the mood swings.   It is affecting my relationship with my fiance,  along with our 3 year old son.   We're starting a business slowly,  however I am becoming more forgetful daily.   It is beginning to become more depressing,  and the outbursts are happening more often. . The emotions are becoming more than we can handle. .   My neurologist tells me it's a side effect of the medication,  however she has been questionable on several occasions before.   I'm happy to find out more about this topic,  so I can deal with it more easily.   Also,  because of the extent of my case,  a lot of the medication has failed in the past.

Thanks in part to my own efforts, accommodations were made to many other employees -- if/when the 'managerial will' was there --  but I'd become known as too much of an 'advocate' for my clients/the ADA process, and they wanted to get rid of me.. and so they did.

I had one neurologist back in 1981 who suggested that it may have been caused by a possible stroke during birth.  Fast-forward technology about 30 years later, and my current neurologist disagrees with that prognosis.  Saying that a stroke typically leaves scar tissue behind.  But, according to my latest MRI, there was no scar tissue to support the stroke theory.  So, again, we have what may be the cause but no definitive proof of exact cause.","2014-08-13T02:15:53+0000",0,"10152705347042664_10152706458112664"

I still do have many absence seizures a day along with my partial complex ones.

APPTS. ABOUT ME, NOT YOU!  I DON'T NEED YOU INTERRUPTING ME,  TO TALK ABOUT YOUR HEALTH! AND ADDING BITS AND PIECES ABOUT THINGS YOU HAVE NO IDEA ABOUT, ESPECIALLY SINCE YOU DO NOT EVEN LIVE WITH ME!!!!!!!!
After I told my father off he not permitted in any drs. appts., nor any drs. treatments, physical therapy or anything dealing with ANY DRS. that talk to me. Even if it is in th ER. I TOLD HIM, IF THAT HURTS YOUR FEELINGS, I'M JUST EXPRESSING HOW I FEEL, AND HOW SOME DRS. HAVE  EXPRESSED TO ME, WHILE  YOU ARE BEING THE ROOM DURING MY TREATMENTS.  YOU ARE DISRUPTING THEM, AND CAUSING THEM TO CUT MY TIME IF WHAT THEY NEED TO ASK,  OR DO! 
SO.......after that nice little conversation,  he waits I the waiting room, or if something happens, and he is needed,  then he is allowed. He is not permitted to even read what I may have to sign, nor is he permitted to speak on my behave if we are in the ER, and I can't speak, like when I had my Stroke in 2012. I tried to sign, but it was hard since I was paralysed on one side of my body, but it was just my left side,  but I did what I could with my right. Once my brother came to the ER,  he was able to translate, since I taught him when he was younger, and he still remembered,  and he sometimes has to use it for his job, and he knows my body language, considering he lives with me. So he, and my mother know my body language without me saying a word, since I do live with my Mother.  She works, since I am disabled with a lot of things, while my father is, I guess disabled, but he doesn't work, so that's my transportation. That is also, I hope answers your question, EPILEPSY ADVOCATE.......anything else, you can send it to me by way of  message.

A person can die in a seizure. That's a fact. Seizure activity, as our captain says, is nothing to clown around about.
I get tired of people doing that. I'm not a saint. I'm an Emergency Medical Technician at the Paramedic level.
I wish there were more classes that explain how serious seizure activity really is. Sometimes, I think some people NEED to feel the import behind the words.

The most difficult for me are partial seizures.  Blanking out for a few seconds during a conversation, staring off into space, or certain odd uncontrollable body movements.  With these seizures I have found people aren't as supportive or understanding.  I don't have issues with people that do not know me.  What I have issues with and what really stings are the friends and family that do know.  Many make snide, low brow comments like ""look at me when I'm talking to you,"" snapping their fingers in you face, treating you like an idiot, rolling their eyes when you talk or just plain being mean and rude.  I understand that it is ignorance and education is needed.

I have been on just about every drug out there and have lived anything but a normal life.  I did everything I could to live with it and try to not let it interrupt my life too much.  I was a very loyal and accountable employee until finally it took over my life.  I never called in sick unless I had to go to the ER because I couldn't function without having a seizure.  Finally I went to a new dr. earlier this year and was introduced to something called VNS.  I had this implant put in back in March.  It has made a tremendous difference in my quality of life!  I can actually go to sleep and not be so concerned about having horrible seizures in my sleep or wake up having them.  I'm not cured, but I definitely have a better quality of life!  Thanks to everyone involved in making this possible!  One thing that is essential in having Epilepsy, even as an adult is having a good support system and someone around to help you almost at all times.  I have never been able to live on my own because of this.","2012-08-16T15:15:48+0000",4,"10151189779992664_8456194"

I worry cause before Jan 28, 2010 I had a happy go lucky 7 year old who didn't have a care in the world. Now she does not like to be around people cause she fears having a seizure around them and has become more of an introvert.

"5835","10152360360249438","Marianne Iozzo","I have a question: Does anyone know of a program to take a dog that is currently living with someone who has seizures and shows signs of being able to tell when a seizure is coming on for training? Everything I have seen is for dogs already in the programs. Just a few months before my brother's first seizure I got him an akc yellow lab, he went two years before his last seizure a few months back and Bailey (the dog)  sat in front of my brother and started to stare at him minutes before the seizure came on.  If he can sense these things and we can teach him how to hone in on that and let someone know when they happen since my brother lives in an upstairs apartment alone would be great. Any ideas?","2012-08-14T14:28:55+0000",2,"10151160400137664_8439250"

Just learn tour ways, who, what, were and when. After timeyou no yourself of where you can or can't go or do. Stress is a no, no !! How you fell before it happened, flashing lights , starring at something for a period of time, going in circles , amusment rides.

"6139","10154234417450611","Jennifer Thomas","My daughter began experiencing seizures at 3 months old. Nobody believed me, at first, that anything was going on because they were so short and infrequent. I knew. I just knew.For years I dealt with it without any kind of diagnosis and everyone thinking I was being overly cautious and making a big deal out of nothing. She started preschool and the teacher would send home discipline notes every day about how she wouldn't listen. How she spent too much time daydreaming. About how she was defiant and would sit and stare at her desk instead of lining up with the other kids.. I told them what I had suspected since she was an infant. They didn't believe me. I told her doctor. She said ""Sometimes kids just daydream..""  At seven, she complained on New Years Day of a headache.. Then, her seizure started. I drove through a blizzard to get her to the emergency room and the seizure was still taking place. They finally believed me. She is now 8. Her seizures are for the most part under control.

Coping with epilepsy and patients like me are great sites that offer help, advice, and support. I belong to them too. It helped me with my decision for brain surgery and coping with epilepsy, and I felt less alone. My friends and family dont have it, and don't fully understand, but they listen and offer support. Instead talking to people with epilepsy has helped me accept, cope, and deal with the struggles of everyday life we live.
