Even if it is controlled with medication it does not matter. Having epilepsy when I was younger, and they didn't know what was wrong with me, it was hell for me as a child growing up. It made my already teased, and bullied, struggle to learn situation so much worse. I made it, but there is some irreversible damage, and problems that I have to overcome everyday. I am happy that they know more about epilepsy nowadays, thanks to groups like this, and medical research.

"negative"	"My heart goes out to all who suffer from this condition/disorder as my son and husband both had seizures.  I lost my son when he suffered a seizure on Easter Sunday, April 12, 2009 and died of asphyxiation.  My husbands seizures however did not take him from me, he died of brain cancer in the motor cortex as well as other places.  The most important thing i found out regarding epilepsy is that the patients need to be diligent about taking meds and that they need the right doctor with continuity of care.  Over the 40 years of our marriage my husband would decide he didn't need his meds and we would have episodes of status epilepsy.  He did this early in our marriage but go better because I was relentless about making sure he had his meds.  When our loved ones are having seizures we have to be advocates for them both in hospitals and with doctors because they can't speak for themselves.  They need to see doctors who are especially trained in epilepsy.  My husbands seizures were so bad that we finally got him in to see an epileptologist at Duke University and he prescribed medicine for him that I would administer to him if he started having one seizure after another so that we did not have to make a trip to an ER.  Going to ER always made things worse because the doctors would change his meds and it could take months to gain back the ground we had lost.  My son was a different story as he was very noncompliant in taking his meds and he was also bipolar and had hemophilia.  He was his own worst enemy when it came to his conditions but he was a grown man and as a mother there was only so much I could do to help him especially after the government put rules in place that prevented parents from having access to medical information on their children once the reached puberty.  When patients are having seizures they cannot communicate with medical personnel therefore for those of you who have children or a significant other you ned to make sure that someone has healthcare power of attorney in these type situations or your hands are tied. If things are not available in hospitals that are essential for diagnosis and treatment of your loved ones take them to a facility that has the proper equipment.  You loved ones can't fight for themselves so you have to do it for them.  If i can be of assistance for any of you please feel free to contact me.  It took me 40 years to learn what I know about epilepsy and treatment and i am happy to share what I know if it will help even one person or one parent from losing a child as I lost mine.  Praying for all.  May God bless you all."	"Brenda Johnson"	"4"

"negative"	"It enhanced my depression, finding the right meds became demanding, I had just been promoted when I first started getting them. The meds screwed up my head pretty badly. I had to re-learn how to work in the corporate world. I went from a nearly photographic memory to being unable to remember what was said to my face after I walked away. The stress of changing my life, because it was so much harder, just made everything get worse. I have serious depression as well and the combination has made me a different person. I am angry, I am sad, I am hurt and always feel broken. My seizures are controlled by a nice expensive cocktail of meds, but I eventually have a breakthrough seizure then have to work from there. 
I started making bad choices and feeling like I wasn't myself. It caused me to leave one stressful, but familiar, job for a different stressful job, which I ended up walking out on. I got three more good jobs after that, but was treated differently in every one of them once I had a seizure in the office. I was treated with kid gloves, but in a completely biased way. I was looked over for promotions, I became the black sheep or the problem child. I did work equal to or better than my teammates but it wasn't relevant.
I had friends, and I literally have none. I hurt emotionally and physically every day. I spent five months job searching,  interviewing, writing cover letters and changing my resume and thank you notes only to come up completely dry. My depression is dark and vicious and I have another cocktail of meds for that. Then I take concentration meds because I'm so tired, and I take pain meds because my body hurts every day.
I was fun, funny, athletic, likeable, nice, and good-hearted. Now I'm just not. I used to play volleyball with friends and then at some point I just wasn't on the team anymore. Same with basketball. And happy hours. And sitting with a group of friends with season tickets for football games. And stopped being asked to go to things. Etc.

So other than losing jobs, changing my speech patterns, adding very dark, negative thoughts into my everyday life, gaining 135 lbs, changing how I feel, keeping me in constant vigilance, disrupting the plans of my retired parents, alienating me from friends and colleagues, adding fear to my son and wife if I make a strange noise or breathe funny, feeling judged and discriminated against often, feeling insecure personally, causing me pain, making me a worse person with less ideals and hopes to being judgmental, angry, and mouthy, it hasn't impacted me or my relationships in any way.

He has had epilepsy since age 8, worked all his life,  controlled with medication until October of 2013, when he began to have breakthrough seizures and since no medication has worked. Dealt with looks when he seized in public but never a helping hand. Remarks from his coworkers calling him names like retard. Or people refusing to be next to him. He underwent many studies, test etc. To determine where the seizures are coming from. He had surgery in December 2014, new year's Eve..we, I thought finally, a new year a new start for our lives. Didn't work. Still seizing, all grand mal, we don't have any warning of when they will come and like you I deal with his state afterwards. He can't work either. And because of his condition, there are many simple things we take for granted I can't have him do. He is going through occupational, speech and physical therapy once a week.

"negative"	"The stigma and even judgment from people continues to astound me.  Having gone through breast cancer and the many failed reconstruction surgeries, chemo, septic infections (which is thought is what caused my epilepsy), all of it was easy compared to what has come from having epilepsy.  People treat you like you are crazy, made it up - you name it.  I mentioned in another post, I even had an ER room kick me out, after arriving by ambulance, from a drop seizure that left me unable to walk or control my left side.  But, with it, has come many awakenings.    My politics, my views on law enforcement, pretty much everything changed after one too many abuses - inflicted on me and seeing others (like kids and dogs) go through it.  Mine are not under control either.  Working has gone from professional to little cleaning jobs and stuff (also awakened me to how many of these people are treated).  I have gone through long periods without working, which devastated me and my daughter financially, but kept going.  I'm glad to hear of a supportive spouse and glad I found this site.  After having even my primary care physician treat it like I had lost my mind, I found one of the best neurologist in the country who gets it.  Thanks for sharing your story about stigmas."

He is so strong...I don't know what I'd do without him.  He definitely loves me and my son.  Wish I would have talked to him when we were in school.  :)"	"Suzanne Stone Shields"	"5"

"negative"	"I didn't have problems falling asleep. My last job was working at a convenience store and people would call in saying they couldn't work their shift, so being a manager, I'd have to. Working an 8 hour shift on 2-3 hours of sleep would always trigger my seizures. My boss would come in and refused to let me go home as soon as he got to work. Fortunately I found a good doctor who wouldn't stand for it and put me on disability. I haven't worked in over 3 years and was deemed permanently disabled last year because my seizures were so bad."

Take a long deep breath, Let this first lung full of air out at a speed that is twice as long as it took to fill them. breath in deep again and repeat. Change the balance so the inhale is as long as the exhale and truly focus on the rhythm. what ever ""crap"" you have on your mind will give way to maintaining the equal rhythm, personally I can be asleep in about 5 min tired or not. Your body will seem to sleep what it needs if you are not interrupted by external intrusions.

"negative"	"It seems like everyone on tv who has seizures has grand mal seizures. It is just for the shock value. I don't really feel it's the best way to do it, though. The average person doesn't know what seizures are like except for what they see on tv. People never know I'm having seizures unless I tell them, or unless they are very familiar with my situation. Except for the obvious grand mal seizure which everyone recognizes. I've been mistaken as drunk, high, and retarded. Once in a HOSPITAL while visiting a friend I had a seizure (grand mal) in a bathroom, and woke up in the PSYCH WARD!!!! They probably found me when I was partly awake and confused. I don't recall it. It just irks me that in a hospital I was misdiagnosed so badly, and I could have needed medical help from a fall in the bathroom with the hard walls and floors.... Obviously, once evaluated they realized I was fine, mentally. Looking back I kind of feel like I should have done something. It was SO wrong!!!"	"Deloris Constance"	"0"

"negative"	"The brain is a miraculous tool and there are many ways to get around some of our memory difficulties.  As for my biggest difficulty it is my spatial recognition and memory.

Fortunately my auditory memory is fairly good so if I talk myself through situations and describe things and situations to myself I am able to compensate for my lack of visual/spatial memory.

I'm epileptic and will never apologize for anything involving my seizures. If anything, non-epileptics should apologize to us. I've met so many epileptics who are actually ashamed to the point where they hide it from everyone. That's messed up. If I can't remember a fact, or someone's name, I may certainly will not apologize. Just, ""I have epilepsy and that's what seizures do. They damage your brain."" usually that prompts a conversation about epilepsy wherein I correct all the stupid things non-epileptics think about epilepsy and seizures.

It's been a bit over 20 years that she's worked with him - epilepsy surgery at Mayo and VNS implanted, he's still not totally controlled, but he's light years ahead of where he was.

"negative"	"These comments are AWESOME!!! SO, I HAVE to share a mini version of my Eplipsey Saga... I had my first grandma in the shower, while my mom was at work in... A HOSPITAL... the medics wrapped my burned body in a bath towel!!! So, I had to be put in a tub of ice.. Then, grafting surgery.. I was 27!!! Spent the next ten years being called a Retard, freak... Losing job after job.. And.. My Dr's. Spending less than 15mns with me, every six months.. Blaming my onset on my Female hormones... And, doping me up on meds... A client for years, helped get me in for tests at the MAYO... One hour there and meeting my doctor.. He told me I had a brain tumor, non-cancerous and BRAIN SURGERY was the answer... WOW!!! 9 Nerologists, 7 MRI's, and 32 medications... And.. I was probably born with this!!! The MAYO was blown away... I had surgery ten years ago this past week.. And, have only had two seizures in the past ten years... BUT, that label has stuck with me.. Because Now, I have side effects of the chuck of my brain they removed... I was very fortunate... I do my best to go on.. Pay the gift my customer gave me forward... And... Would like to tell the world my story, because of the label, Sigma, etc.. That continues... I was lucky to have met Coach Jerry Kill a year ago (MN golfers coach with Epilepsy) told him he was my Hero... I pray that social media can help prove that those with Seizures & Eplipsey are VERY capable of living life.. Coach Kill is a shinning example (college educated, great coach) and he is working with my local Epilepsy foundation to help pass along this label is unfounded... <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+0082> I was blessed at my Worst...

In 2/18/2005 they removed the remainder of my temporal lobe and my hippocampus.  At the age of 35, after my second surgery my hair grew back in totally gray. It had been very dark brown.

""Do you love him?"" 
""Yeah . . . "" 
""Then anything is possible.""

"negative"	"Be sure your Dr. has YOUR best interest at heart, and not just his/her's (basically, all they want to do is CYA). Had same neurologist for 20 years (not by choice, parents picked him out when I was still child). Kept him until my 30's, when his 'expertise' almost killed me with Steven Johnson's syndrome, told me I should never have children b/c if I ever get divorced no one would give me custody of my child (WTF?!), and told me he couldn't cure me, just help 'control' seizures (which his answer was to overmedicate me). Do NOT be afraid to question their actions or suggestions, based on your needs and lifestyle. And when they decide it's ok for you to wait 2 hours AFTER your scheduled appt (that you had to leave work for b/c unlike a neurologist, you aren't a millionaire) that you had to catch a ride too as well b/c you can't drive, then its time to say you and your time are worth more to someone who cares..... 4 years, seizure free all b/c of a NEW dr. that found out more about me in 2 week hospital stay than previous dr. did in 20 years."

When I had brain surgery, when I woke up from it, I didn't know anything, anyone, who I was, I didn't know a word of english, I didn't even know how to move my arms and legs. Luckily over the years much has come back to my memory but not all of it. I have forgot many things like I did in my past. Especially the good things. I went through high school only knowing the words yes and no. While having on average 3-5 grand mals a week. I would wake up with pee and sometimes poop all over me in the middle of the hallways. Everyone would be laughing and pointing fingers at me. Now its funny too me but back then it was 24 hour stress. Panic attacks and much more."	"Mike Anderson"	"0"

"negative"	"Pay right temporal lobectomy I couldn't remember what happened,  was said, what I saw 2 minutes ago.   Tomorrow will be 7 years since the surgery and I have learned that though my memory doesn't always work I can work with my memory.  Routine is important,  the more practice in routine you are the less things you have to consciously remember daily.  Then,  find the tools that work for you, whether written or electronic, and use them regularly.  Lastly, ask for help from others as you learn to compensate for what was lost."	"Kelly Porter"	"4"

"negative"	"I Found Out that they're Certain Medications Out there; whether they're Old/New That could help w/the Memory Recovery. It just depends upon What Type of Seizures y'all have: & Which Rx's will work for y'all. We've all got 1 thing in common; that's the Seizures. We all need to learn to listen to Our Bodies. If you're Lucky enough to have warnings; then notice, when and/or where: they happen. Read your Rx Labels, and find out which One's Affect you. Then Explain to your Doctor, how Those Medications are Affecting y'all. Tell your Doctor's y'all want Medications w/ 1 Side Affect but without another. That's how you'll find out which Medications will work for y'all. Whenever y'all are put on a New Medication; If those New Medications have a Negative Effect Then Tell them that 1 Medication is Counteracting 1 or the Other Medications; then They'll be able to Find Out Which One's they are. Some Of Our can be Controlled w/Work, & Other's Controlled by Certain Temperature Ranges. Your Prescription Vials/Labels will say which Medications can handle what kind of temperatures they can Handle. So if y'all live in an Environment where it's Warmer than Cold: Then you'll want a Rx that will  keep you from Sweating to Death; or If you Live in a Colder Climate; Than you'll want an Rx that will keep you from Freezing to Death."

Thank God nobody was seriously injured, but that was his last day of driving and working. I know its hard at 27 to lose that kind of independence, but we have tho think of how many people he could have killed, including himself.

Get plenty of sleep, dont spend a lot of time using a computer as watching the screen change with each click can trigger an episode as I am told. Never tthink you are less than anyone else. You are just as good as anyone. People have problems and this is something you cannot help, and it is certainly nothing to be ashamed of. Hold your head high, trust in God, and take care of yourself.

I understand I probably scared them when having them. I just think they should've given me the opportunity to explain it. Back in the 80's I was pushed away or picked on because of my behavior. I was scared and wished I had friends then. That's why today when I see someone with this disability I listen and offer my attention in every way. I let them know I know what their going thru.

You pretty much have to quit your job or take a medical leave, or go on Disability if you lose your license. If you support yourself and reside in an area that family do not reside in, you don't just find travelling to work or to the grocery stores, etc. doesn't make getting around ""just a little more difficult"", it makes it impossible. That's why so many people have a seizure and will not be open to tell their health care provider as they don't want to be reported to the MOT or DMV. It's can be totally life changing for the worse.

"negative"	"I see comments here about not driving. using public transit, depending on friends etc. I saw one that suggest receiving disability as an option. I have no public transit available to me, my friends all have lives of their own and cannot be my personal chauffeurs, I have applied for disability and was turned down because I am otherwise physically able to work and inability to drive is not a valid reason to receive disability. What I see here are people who are afraid to live and choose to use their epilepsy as an excuse to not do so. People who are not epileptic have vehicle accidents every day and it is usually due to carelessness. Risks are a natural part of life and driving a vehicle for anyone is a risky thing. Yes you should take precautions to avoid the possible negative effects of risky behavior, but taking risks in life are necessary, if you avoid taking risks, you fail to live life to it's fullest. If you marry some one, you take the risk that that marriage might fail, but you will never know unless you take the risk, come what may. Use as much caution as possible, but take the risk and get out and live."	"Roger White"	"1"

After that incident I went home, parked the driver's permit in the draw and I'm 50yrs old now and still don't drive. I have a full life, seizure more or less controlled I am allowed to get a license if I so choose. But I'll be damned if I'll be responsible for putting other people's live's at risk because I am so very much in need of an independence I can achieve in other ways. It just isn't worth it.

I get frequent migraines, my vision isnt the same so it makes them worse, i cant concentrate, and the memory loss is no help at all. Is your son having issues in school? Maybe you should consider it as a sign. If not sit down and talk to him. I think it's  great that you follow this page, and trying to learn more. It is very difficult  to have to accept that this is our life. The headaches, losing  careers, and not remembering the most important event in our lives.

Then the doctors,after 72 hour EEG in hospital stay,inwhich she did not have a single seizure,lol,go figure. The long term insurance company which was paying her long term leave pay cut her checks off immediately. Reason was the doctors found nothing wrong during her stay. She has little seizure meds left,and we cannot afford almost a $1,000.00 a month. This just causes more stress and ofcource more seizures. Without some kind of help from somewhere,her condition is only worsening. She was getting scheduled by her primary doctor to go to the Mayo Clinic,but with no insurance and no income things are not looking to good. She has multiple seizures back to back,and it's not good. Since January 1st,she has had episodes daily,but in that time she has had 5 days that she was seizure free,a Blessing. I have been writing done her episodes on paper,but who in the long pays for her condition is her. She has been having seizures since age 12,the last 2 years have been ridiculous.

I have had seizures in public and that can be really embarrassing. I have learned that the people don't forget but aren't rude. They will ask how I am or just say hi. I have been blessed to live where there are kind people. I read a comment someone said they had a hole new meaning to short term memory, I understand that and can add new meaning to long term memory. Things we learned as young people, every day things, I sometimes can't remember. It is frustrating that I cannot work.

I've learned to make little eye contact with people on the street and in establishments, etc., as I so oftentimes do not remember them, but they remember me.  I've learned as well, especially now living in a very small town, not to engage in very many stories or day-to-day experiences, as I have had people say that I told them that before.  It's usually little things, like a cute story of a local dog, etc., but I just don't do it.  All the same, I guess without asking for it, because I do police accountability with regards to abuse to the disabled, the elderly, children, and dogs, they more and more know who I am anyway.  As my work grows, but my memory flails, I guess my message is delivered and brings attention all the same.  I just wish the attention never feel on me.  It does all the same."	"Gina Goodman"	"0"

When I had my first seizure, I was in the middle of breast cancer surgery/treatment complications (double masect, failed reconstructions, septic infections- - which is probably what caused the epilepsy), but all of that pales in comparison to the experience of the epilepsy diagnosis.  I could not remember where I lived, where I worked, thought my daughter was 9 when she was 11, didn't remember that our dog had passed away (2 years prior), etc. Could only remember a select few people.

I had been having déjà vu for as long as I can remember, but thought everyone had that.  One night I woke up in a complex type seizure.  My parents took me to the hospital where I had a grand mal seizure.  It took a month or more to mentally get back to normal.  No doctor has ever been successful at controlling mine.  Most months if I am going to have one, it will happen two weeks prior to my menstrual cycle begins.  I had a simple partial seizure two days ago right after exercising.  My memory is effected by my seizure.  Sometimes it takes days to be back to normal and sometimes it only hours.  I am a teacher with a Masters Degree in School Counseling.  It is by God's grace that I have mentally been able to accomplish what I have.  The seizures are very frustrating for me.  I do not like not being able to remember things.  No one seems to understand.  I have to work EXTRA hard to compensate for it.  I just take it a day at a time.  That is all I can do."	"Erica Acord Griffin"	"0"
"negative"	"Simple partials would just be an aura. For me it was a rising epigastric sensation--kind of like going down hill on a roller coaster-- and a sudden feeling of doom. I would also instantly become hyper - aware of my surroundings. All of this in just a few seconds. During a complex partial, I would have the aura and I would sense a need to escape.

It was humiliating, needless to say they hired someone else.  I still wish I could go back and tell them ""I wasn't lying! I am smarter than I seemed that day!

"negative"	"I must confess, even after two accidents, it took a threat from a neurologist to turn me in the the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) if I didn't surrender my license, in order to get me to stop driving.  Thankfully, my first accident only involved me and my car.  I actually injured - thank the Lord not seriously - a person in the second accident, went for several years without driving, then started back up again.  At a regularly scheduled appointment, the neurologist saw me dig my car keys out of my pocket as I was leaving his office.  He gave me until the end of the next business day, to turn my license in to the DMV, or he would report me - and he made good on that promise.  I was FURIOUS at the time, but have been thankful ever since.  My son is a fire fighter/paramedic, and has told me some real horror stories of accidents he's seen that were caused by people with epilepsy, in which they or someone they hit was seriously injured or killed, because the patient, whose seizures weren't 100% controlled, continued to drive either without a license, or they had never told anyone they had epilepsy, and still had their license.   With help from family, friends, and the local bus, I can get anywhere I need to go.  It's just not worth the risk.  Even as a bus passenger one time, I got off the bus just as one of my complex-partial seizures began.  The next thing I knew - which could have been anywhere from seconds to a couple of minutes - I was standing out in the middle of a six lane major boulevard, horns honking, people yelling, vehicles screeching to a halt, as I stood in the middle of the intersection.

"negative"	"Just A Dog ?

For all of my animal lover friends....

From time to time, people tell me, ""lighten up, it’s just a dog,"" or, ""that’s a lot of money for ""just a dog"".

They don’t understand all the generous people involved,  the distance traveled, the time spent, the hours of training.  Or the costs involved for ""just a dog"".

Tim, you are stupid for paying that much money for ""just a dog"". As Garth saves my life the first week I had ""just a dog"".

Some of my proudest moments have come about with ""just a dog"".After all of you made it possible for me to have"" just a dog ""and all he has done for me I figured it was time to give back, if ""just a dog"" could bring me so much happiness then why not spread the love! So we visit the Children's hospital and visit with otherwise lonely sienor citizens.  It just makes me happy to see a sick child or lonely sienor get the same joy that I get from ""just a dog""! 

Many hours have passed and my only company was ""just a dog,"" because I can now be left alone again so my fiance can work, and have her independence back!  But I did not once feel slighted or afraid being left alone with ""just a dog"".

Some of my saddest moments have been brought about by ""just a dog,"" and in those days of darkness, the gentle touch of ""just a dog"" gave me comfort and reason to overcome the day.Or waking up in the ICU units with ""just a dog"" between my legs quiet and waiting only to check on me! ""Just a dog"" has never complained, a true loyalty I cannot explain! 

If you, too, think it’s ""just a dog,"" then you will probably understand phrases like ""just a friend,"" ""just a sunrise,"" or ""just a promise"".

""Just a dog"" brings into my life the very essence of friendship, trust, and pure unbridled joy. And now independence and Garth <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B0><U+0095> makes it possible to do things that you all take for granted like driving and feeling safe alone, knowing Garth <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B0><U+0095> will alert or call help if I seize.

""Just a dog"" brings out the compassion and patience that make me a better person.

Because of ""just a dog"", I will rise early, take long walks and look longingly to the future. Now I can go anywhere with ""just a dog"" and am comfortable that when the time arises, ""just a dog"" will do what all those hours of training taught ""just a dog"" to do!

So for me and folks like me, it’s not ""just a dog"" but an embodiment of all the hopes and dreams of the future, the fond memories of the past, and the pure joy of the moment.

""Just a dog"" brings out what’s good in me and diverts my thoughts away from myself and the worries of the day.

I hope that someday they can understand that it’s not ""just a dog"", but the thing that gives me humanity, independence and keeps me from being ""just a man"".

So the next time you hear the phrase ""just a dog"" just smile... because they ""just don’t understand

The next day I would have terrible Migraine headache and light seizures.  I was given all different medication, nothing worked. Until I was on a plane home, and happen to be seated next to a top Neurologist that had a new medication, that was just right for me? My Neurologist allowed me to take it. It was and has been great. The most important thing I have listened to God's word for me, is to eat well. I ate peanut butter every night. I found foods that I am allergic to THAT being one. It closed my throat,  and caused many of the problems. Another is anti- fungal diet and medication. No white bread, yeast or sugar. This was a cause of low blood sugar. That is a main cause of MY EPILEPSY. I still take medication and always will. Finding a better way to eat, and let God bring you through this,  is the Way. :) I too was in an accident due to not eating.

May 2015 will be one year since i have suffered a grand mal seizure. I began seeing a new neurologist a few weeks ago to hopefully be able to start driving again. All i have been dealing with is some sleep issues (sleep walking mainly) since my one yr old son was born. This neurologist ordered an eeg and a sleep study for me. I did my eeg last week and to my surprise, it came back very abnormal. My doctor told me i am suffering from silent seizures and have at least ten or more an hour. This was a huge slap in the face. All this time when i thought i was getting better, i have actually been getting worse. Who knows when i will ever be able to drive or if i will ever be able to drive again. I am just ready to have my life back and be able to take my kids anywhere they need to go without having to make sure it doesnt interfere with anyone elses schedule. It just seems so unfair. Im staying positive as best i can and am searching for an online support group. I refuse to let this illness slip me into a deep depression as it has done in the past. If anyone has any advice for me to point me in the direction of others who also deal with this, it would be greatly appreciated. My doctor increased and added more meds to stabilize the seizures but its up to me of course to not allow this to affect me emotionally. I am just ready to have my life back 100 percent.

"negative"	"A simple partial seizure that only affects your senses is called an aura. 

AURAS

The part of your brain where your seizures originate (your seizure focal point) also may be linked to a specific type of aura because an aura represents the beginning of a seizure. Since different parts of the brain are responsible for different things, the warning signs you experience will be related to the functions of the section of brain where the seizure is about to occur. People whose seizures begin in the temporal lobe tend to have certain types of auras and those whose seizures begin somewhere else often will have different types. 

Here are some types of auras that can happen alone or in combinations…

Visual changes

Kaleidoscope effects, Visual hallucinations, Shimmering sensations, Vibrating visual field, Distortions in size, shape or distance of objects, Bright lights or blobs, Zigzag lines, Tunnel vision, Blind or dark spots in the field of vision, Curtain-like effect over one eye, Blindness in one eye, Motionless stare, Dilated pupils,

Auditory changes

Hallucinations — hearing voices or sounds that don’t exist, Being unable to understand spoken words, Muffled sounds, Buzzing noises, Loud or whispered volume, Temporary deafness

Physical changes

Weakness, unsteadiness, Changes in heart rate, Sweating, Nausea, Vertigo, Saliva collecting in mouth, Lip smacking, Chewing, Swallowing, Strange smells, Problems speaking, Repetitive movements, Limbs jerking involuntarily, Numbness or tingling on one side of face or body, Feeling of being separated from your body, Needing to urinate

Psychological changes

Confusion, Anxiety or fear, Physical detachment, Déjà vu or Jamais vu, a sense of familiarity or unfamiliarity"	"Chris Arceneaux"	"1"

"negative"	"My son is 8, he was just recently diagnosed with complex partial seizers. We did a long term monitoring to find out what part of his brain is causing them and found out it is his whole left side. He is coherent during his seizers and knows everything that is happening. His whole body will stiffen up and shake like with a grand mal but he can speak. He will cry and yell mom over and over until I get by his side. Then he just cries until it is done. Before a seizer happens his right leg will go numb and within 24 hours he will have one. Then immediately after and for about 5-10 minutes his right leg will be numb and he will be unable to move it or stand. When he has a seizer, he will normally have at least two within an hour of each other, but not always. The Dr still doesn't know exactly what is causing them, but now my son has to see a different Dr because his left."	"Crystal L Hicks"	"0"

"negative"	"It's a peculiar feeling, detached and floating but also a tingling. At least that's how it starts. The problem is that they don't stop. One triggers the next in a cascade, which was a nightmare before doctors finally diagnosed me and got me on a drug regimen. 
This year POS became partial complex, which I suppose means the overall situation is getting worse."	"John VanHez"	"0"
"negative"	"I get a very dizzy spinning feeling about 10 sec before I fall. I usually try to sit down during this time but usually wake up on the ground anyways.  I can hear sound before I wake up and I already know ive had one before I open my eyes.  I can never talk or understand much for a few minutes after.

"negative"	"I am 53 right now & have had them since I was 16.I have petit mal seizures that happen once every month or so.Sometimes its a gap of 2 to four months between them.But when they happen,I am asleep somewhere between 8pm 8am & sometimes when I take the medication in the morning,like 7am,I will take my dose,go back to bed & start to feel a lightheaded headache & just sit in bed & do nothing or lay down with my head propped up on a pillow a little,have a few wheat crackers & a little ice-tea & think about what I have to do for the day the feeling slowly goes away or like this morning,I will wake,its in the 40s outside & feel hot all over & need to cool down.I take socks & blankets off & try to cool down.After a half hour or so,that feeling is gone I feel normal again.The sweats & hot feeling can wake me right up.I always have next to my bed,wheat crackers,a 16oz bottle of ice-tea,books & mag & my pill case.This to relax & take my mind off whats going on.Sometimes I go to work & feel better as the day goes on.If I have had one overnight,I know the next morning from a headache to I have bitten my tongue or the side of my mouth.I will relax & do nothing,maybe read,sleep & then the laptop.I have written alot,but its help this morning now to feel normal again.Its been about two months since the last attack & I would like to make it a four month gap."

"positive"	"Simple-Partial seizures really don't require any recovery time for me.  Unless you know me as well as my wife you won't even know that I am having a seizure.  And she only catches about half of them.  What helps me the most is to NOT focus on the S-P seizure and remember to breathe.  As soon as I start to focus on a S-P I am much more likely to push myself into a Complex-Partial.  There are no perfect answers.  Everyone has a different body so remember that.

If I drive I risk injuring other people. When walking (and this has happened several times) I risk having a seizure & NO ONE CALLS 911 even though they see me laying on the sidewalk convulsing. When I call Med. Trans. (it is used only for medical appts.) many times I am faced with rudeness, accusations of missing paperwork, questions that involve digging into my personal life. One of the most common questions is ""Do you live within 1mile of a bustop?"" And yes I do. Sometimes this ok, sometimes not. The problem with that: when people drive or walk right by you as if nothing is wrong when your life is in serious danger! So if I can't drive, and I would not want to anyway so as not endanger innocent people, what do I do? I walk as often as possible.

No matter how long you've been seizure free. So, no matter if it's been a year or 6 months of a waiting period.  I believe this is a matter between patients and their doctors. Because not all seizures are alike nor are there impacts the same on each person. Again as I stated, most ppl don't joy ride I think unfortunately, some ppl may drive because they don't have any other choice. It's just my opinion.

Of course I lost my license and continue to have seizures. One dr says seizure free for a year, but my dr says she never wants me to drive again. My girls' beg me to please never drive.

It never really scared me until my husband and I were blessed with a baby girl in December 2012. I had surgery in hopes of helping the seizures but to no avail. We have another baby girl on the way and still I do not worry about the seizures harming me since I have been having them for so long but really I worry about other people, my husband and children.

We got in to see a neurologiest, she put him on anti sesure meds but that one made him so depressed, for about a year.

He was given the option of not going on another medication cut,  but, if he had a driving accident he would lose his license for 3 months at least.  Let alone the guilt if it caused someone else injury.  For his and my peace of mind, he stated on another medication and this one seems to be agreeing with him so far."	"Janice Dodge"	"0"

I was Diagnosed when I was 18yrs just like my mom. Grand-mal seizures and diagnosed as genetic. Here is what I have noticed with myself and wonder if this can help anyone else that may be born with this disease naturally. I am 36 now and must had a baby a year ago.
Here are some factors or things I have noticed. 
1. Hormonally related. Around my period cycle I get (what I call) seizure activity. My mother told me the doctors show on bt had a big debate about new talk about hormones. For me, this is a connection 100%.  I went on birth control (nuvaring since they don't have to up the dose of estrogen in that one). And I felt better!!! Being pregnant I had never felt better in my life and this includes of days of NO SLEEP which normally is a huge trigger for me! 
2. STRESS AND SLEEP is always a factor and always will be. I do my best to control and stay happy with Activities I enjoy, relaxing a lot and making sure I get plenty of sleep. 
3. DIET! CARBS!!!! Carbs are always told its a NO NO bc it makes you fat. WRONG. Your brain cannot function properly without carbs. Anabolic is the term used when your body is starved of these. Don't forget your brain needs these! Make sure your morning has them and keep them consistent through your daily meals!  I have felt seizure activity when I am low. Fast metabolism ppl really need to be careful. 
4. You all know alcohol is a bad idea. It's when the brain comes down from the buzz that you ""detox"" from the substance and that's when  you are seizure prone. 
Please feel free to contact me for more information on remedies you can do yourself to help. I won't clog up this post with a book lol. I hope this has helped anymore. God bless and stay safe everyone!!"	"Jessica Pettengill"	"3"

I was Diagnosed when I was 18yrs just like my mom. Grand-mal seizures and diagnosed as genetic. Here is what I have noticed with myself and wonder if this can help anyone else that may be born with this disease naturally. I am 36 now and must had a baby a year ago.
Here are some factors or things I have noticed. 
1. Hormonally related. Around my period cycle I get (what I call) seizure activity. My mother told me the doctors show on bt had a big debate about new talk about hormones. For me, this is a connection 100%.  I went on birth control (nuvaring since they don't have to up the dose of estrogen in that one). And I felt better!!! Being pregnant I had never felt better in my life and this includes of days of NO SLEEP which normally is a huge trigger for me! 
2. STRESS AND SLEEP is always a factor and always will be. I do my best to control and stay happy with Activities I enjoy, relaxing a lot and making sure I get plenty of sleep. 
3. DIET! CARBS!!!! Carbs are always told its a NO NO bc it makes you fat. WRONG. Your brain cannot function properly without carbs. Anabolic is the term used when your body is starved of these. Don't forget your brain needs these! Make sure your morning has them and keep them consistent through your daily meals!  I have felt seizure activity when I am low. Fast metabolism ppl really need to be careful. 
4. You all know alcohol is a bad idea. It's when the brain comes down from the buzz that you ""detox"" from the substance and that's when  you are seizure prone. 
Please feel free to contact me for more information on remedies you can do yourself to help. I won't clog up this post with a book lol. I hope this has helped anymore. God bless and stay safe everyone!!"	"Jessica Pettengill"	"0"

My seizures have been under control for about a year now, but multiple times a day, I feel like I'm starting to get that deja-vu feeling again. It kind of rises up as a feeling in my throat, but doesn't come all the way. It's like my body's teasing me. I'm nervous that my body may getting used to my medications again and that might be what's causing it, but I don't know. I hope not; I've been on tons of different meds already and have already considered surgery. (Was only put off because my seizures were better controlled). I've caught myself spacing out too. I'm still aware of everything around me, but I just have this urge to stare and I'll do it for what feels like 5 minutes. I tried asking the neuro about it, but I didn't get any answers.

Mind if I ask a question? Has anyone ever felt an intense feeling of doom and fear during a partial onset seizure or know of someone who has?

i have often had hallucinations of all 5 senses at once.....some times they hit in stages...almost like stacking upon one another..... tastes...smells....feelings....sounds....and finally the visions.......
and at times it will only be one or two senses....any combination is possible...

they come when they want...usually with little in the way of warning....

i hear voices as well...
always a womans voice.... 
sometimes singing...
sometime chanting....
but always repeating.....
a phrase...
or a few words....
always something of great meaning....always something i have always known but have a hard time remembering when i am not there......sometimes i will hear a cupple words together...someone saying them...irl or on tv/radio......
and the rest of the world fades back...becomes detached....and those cupple words just repeat....
first in the voice i heard them in ...then in her voice....
then as the vibrations rise in each and every cell...
the music comes....music i can feel as much as hear
 the taste comes...
and all the world turns red......
everything closes in from behind like a head rush gone bad......
blackness swarming and alive with stars closes in around me....
finally even this tears open ...and for just a moment...i am offered a look ...a peek ...into the place the music comes from
and then i am back here.....they always abandon me back to this world ....again and again......

As I aged I was able to control myself during the event.  I was a poor performer in school, some areas I did well such as history.

These ""moments"" stopped three days before we saw her, but he started on medication for the next 10 months, which depressed him horribly,  so when fall hit and he wasn't getting outside as much the depression got worse, he told his PCP that he had feelings of not wanting to live if this is how he was going to feel. So we saw his neurologist three months before the year was up being on that med, she weaned him off of it before we saw her. He was not having any of those ""moments"" at all since taking the meds, but without them, or some meds, there was always the chance of having another, and, perhaps having an accident.  That was enough for him to agree to continue taking some kind of meds for the possiblity.  Before meeting with the neuroologiest hubby did have an MRI which showed that on one side of his hippocampus near the base, there was an enlargement.  He will have another MRI in Feb to see if there is a change.  I asked her point blank if she saw any signs of Alzheimers and she said, not at this time, but if soemthing else, it is a very difficult area to remove something.

I don't think she will have one in the hospital since they make her lay still, but I'm nervous about giving medication without a confirmed diagnosis."	"Angela Braford Tuell"	"2"

I was just trying to get at is that if you know anyone who has epilepsy that goes to bars and such tell them to take it light on the drinking. I'd also always wait a few hours between drinking and taking my meds so they wouldn't mix. Oh and they called the ambulance for me and I declined service from the ambulance.

"negative"	"Hello, my name is Walter, and I would like people to know that it is possible to overcome. I was diagnosed with epilepsy at the age of 15. I was having seizures at least once a month up till I was 25. I also had three grand mal seizures in that 10 year timespan. In 2005 I had a grand mal seizure that landed me in ICU for three days, and in the hospital for a a total of a week. Because of these seizures and state laws, I was not able to get my license to drive. People were telling me that I needed to get used to the fact that I may not ever be able to drive. But, I kept telling them that I would drive some day. To make an already log story short, In 2006 I finally got my drivers license. Also, I have not had a seizure since 2005, and  am not currently taking medication for it.

My oldest daughter was hired on at Walmart as a cashier in July 2014 with them full aware of her epilepsy. During this time on occasions her memory would come and go in which they were aware. Being as a cashier she had issues with remembering to put cash back in the drawer or be in the middle of getting change for her register and would forget leaving the money on top and without honestly thinking walk away from the register doing other things her job requires. They gave a verbal warning and a written warning and both time she explained she ""zones out"" at times and forgets. Well instead of moving her to another position in the store they want her to come in tomorrow and fire her for the same thing that happened to take place Saturday night. I don't know what to do.

"negative"	"First I’d like to say, thanks to everyone for having me here today and for making this Epilepsy awareness project happen! I don’t think there’s any way we can’t say that the world needs to be more aware of Epilepsy – we just can’t say it enough! I’m retired now and I spend a lot of time speaking with individual families and schools – basically anyone saying “I need a mentor – someone who has been here and lived through this.” When I was a young teenager, I would have given ANYTHING to have met someone that could give me guidance who knew what I was going through – but I didn’t get that until I was in my forties. That personal connection is so important. So I’m hoping today to be that resource for people going through what I went through."	"Epilepsy Advocate"	"8"
"negative"	"Once you’ve reached Acceptance, you’re going to start asking yourself: “What are the things I can do to tell if I’m getting better or getting worse?” So I usually say: “If you don’t play to win, why keep score?” While this isn’t a game, we still want to win – so it’s important that we keep score! So what does that mean?

You MUST keep records of your seizure activity. Whether it’s daily or weekly, you need to find some way to keep records of: frequency, severity (how tough), time of day (asleep or awake), and any additional triggers – for me, I track relative stress level (for example, somewhere between 1 and 10).  You need to do one additional thing: it’s important that you can find a way to SUMMARIZE this at a level that is easily understandable by your physician. In my case, I’ve done it at monthly or quarterly levels (though I usually do monthly at this time). In these summarizations, you need to point out any particular changes you’ve had in your personal lifestyle (career changes, stressors, treatment changes, etc) so that you can see patterns that correlate to the activities around you. 

In this picture, you can see an example of a chart I’ve created over the years to share with my physician."	"Epilepsy Advocate"	"4"
"negative"	"Our first question of the day is from Lisa-Marie W: “How do you explain epilepsy/ prepare your students for a possible seizure during the term?”

I first taught in a very rural area in Missouri in the mid 70s, so there was very little information or awareness of epilepsy. I actually never stood up in front of my students and told them “I have epilepsy” – the awareness just wasn’t there. I didn’t want to tell my students because I knew A) they wouldn’t understand and B) there was no way for them to really educate themselves about this disease (remember, this was the mid-70s!!). In my case, I would have about a 10 second aura warning. I would just exit the room and have my seizure in the hallway, collect myself, and then re-enter the room and make some excuse. In two years, I never had a student come up to me to ask what was actually wrong – and this happened to me roughly every two weeks for two years. If I did it today, I would certainly sit down first with my students and say “Today we aren’t going to talk about math – we’re going to talk about Epilepsy.” I would want to talk through exactly what epilepsy is and what it means to me. I may even let the students watch me have a partial-onset seizure at some point just so that they could learn and have first-hand knowledge since so few people actually know about epilepsy."	"Epilepsy Advocate"	"4"
"negative"	"When I speak with patients across the country, I like to focus on 5 important factors: 
-	Acceptance
-	Keeping Score
-	Predicting
-	Playing by the Rules
-	Should I give up?

I’ll touch on Acceptance first. It doesn’t matter if you’ve been recently diagnosed or were diagnosed 10 years ago, at some point you’ll go through the 5 stages of grief: Denial, Anger, Bargaining, Depression, and finally Acceptance. Throughout the first 3 stages, your seizures are still there; and when you move into depression (which you will likely do), your body may respond with increased seizure activity purely as a factor of enhanced stress. 

Until you finally Accept the fact that you have Epilepsy, then (in my opinion) you’re never going to be able to take charge of the problem yourself and be able to take important steps to correct this. “I accept it; I know I have it; NOW what can I do?”"	"Epilepsy Advocate"	"3"
"negative"	"When I was younger, I played basketball and would have seizures on the court. My coach would burn a time-out and get me off the court. After that, he would check on me throughout the game to see how I was feeling and see when I was ready to go back in. This was the same case for baseball, football, etc. Today, people learn they have epilepsy, then go online and find so much information that it can scare them. In my case, I had people in my life who were willing to sit with me and learn what was happening to me and push me to be better – as opposed to just assuming the worse. 

We ended up discovering exactly what was happening to me when I was in seventh grade: we saw a public service announcement on TV that showed “little Johnny” having a seizure on TV and I said to my mom “that’s exactly what happens to me every day” – from that point on we started doing the research it would take to find a way to make me better! My parents gave me an option: they said, do you want to stop doing these things you’re doing or do you want to work hard? I wanted to keep doing these fun activities that I was doing and the only way to do that was to keep on pushing for better treatment. My parents were true mentors for me – they pushed me to keep finding ways to improve my condition."	"Epilepsy Advocate"	"3"

It's hard enough going through the teenage years, let alone, having seizures to deal with.  And now being away at college and still suffering through them on top of everything else, needless to say, it's a huge challenge.

"positive"	"This concludes today's session! I want to thank everyone for spending their day with us! My main message is to never give up and that you must play by the rules if you’re going to succeed. Playing by the rules means working hand-in-hand with your physician to figure out the right path for you and sticking with that; while at the same time making sure you’re putting yourself in the best situations to manage your epilepsy! Thanks to everyone for your time today and we look forward to continue connecting with you all in the future!"	"Epilepsy Advocate"	"2"
"negative"	"My daughter was diagnosed with epilepsy when she was 15 mths. She is now 4 1/2. She has been having a lot of increased behaviors, getting aggressive,  not listening and getting easily agitated. It is difficult to know if these behaviors are resulting from her medication or if she is having seizures that we are unaware of. Maybe she is just going through a stage too? Any input would be greatly appreciated!  ;)"	"Chelsey Sather"	"3"
"positive"	"Once you’ve started tracking your seizure activity, you can begin to notice important patterns and/or triggers. For me, stress is a major trigger. My normal stress level is at a 5 – if I’m sitting at that normal stress level, my seizure activity is normal for me. Now, if I suddenly take on new projects and my stress level spikes to an 8 or 9, then my seizure activity wouldn’t change significantly either. This was good. Unfortunately, as soon as my stress level DROPPED (let’s say down to a 2), then my seizure activity would go up significantly. So it wasn’t during a stressful time that seizures happened – it was actually after the stressful periods when it occurred. For instance, when I was playing basketball, my seizures would occur during time outs or during free throws because the stress had stopped. 

So what does that mean for me now? I have learned how to step myself down from my high stress level down to a normal stress level to avoid the large drops that trigger increased seizure activity. I work to keep my stress levels fairly consistent and avoid significant up-and-down swings in stress. This is the pattern I learned about myself by observing my charts and data – it will be different for any of you for sure, but that’s how it works for me."	"Epilepsy Advocate"	"2"

I had petimals as a young child in the 70's, when they still called them fits and nobody talked about it. I out grew them, but in 2002, had my first grandmal/tonic clonic seizure. I've always been active and as long as my husband & I took precaution, I started running which then turned into doing triathlons. I just completed a half Ironman. 
My seizures had been under control with 2 medications and with that, have been seizure free since 2006. I did have one, after seeing a 3D movie, but as bad as it was, because I am active, my Neurologist believes I came out of it quicker than years past because of my activities.

They jumped a ditch, Mom got scared and slowed down, fell off and broke her arm.  She started her period that year, and she was in the shower when she had her first seizure.  Ganna(my grandma) found her, and man she was freaked.  She'd barely even heard of epilepsy.  
Also in that year, they moved from a house to basically an empty lot.  The five of them lived in their garage for the first year or two.  They carried everything in the kids' little red wagon, on foot; no one helped them.  Perhaps all related to Mom's epilepsy, maybe not.  Mystery."	"Marinda Boydstun"	"0"

Let me know what you think and feel because either in our past and even now, I still have these emotions on what I need to do to be considered 'ME'  I titled it 'You Can Call Me'....5/23/2014
 You Can Call Me...

When you're not expecting it,
I can take control
Grasp your mind, thoughts, and body
given enough time, I can pull your heart from your soul.

When you're out and about,
I can make look like a fool
embarrass you outright
Because you are just my tool.

I am always here with you,
And I refuse to leave
I'm right here on your shoulder, 
right on your sleeve.

I can take you anytime,
Yes anytime I want
I can introduce my self at any given moment
My power have I can always flaunt.

I have been called many things,
you can cuss me at your leisure 
Yes, I have many names, 
But you can call me seizure

"negative"	"I, like everyone here, has a story. Everyone's is unique to each individual. My self, have had epilepsy since I was 13yrs old(I am 40 now). Lost jobs, suspended(or revoked) Driver's License, I can't remember, it's been so long. I haven't driven since 1999. Been on disability ever since. But unable to drive or work, I still found something I love to do AND make money too. I am now a professional photographer. I am able to to do shoots at my time, when I feel comfortable. I'm not told when or how to do something. I am my own boss! I write my own schedule. So if anyone out there is unable to be successful in the general  workforce, Find something unique to you and begin your own business. So many things you can do, things that come so natural, even to the point you don't even realize you are unique. There are people out there that need what you can do and are willing to pay for your abilities simply because they can't accomplish what you can. If it's a simple service you can offer or a every day thing that you have a strong potential doing, people need it. Find your market, aim for that market, and fulfill the needs and wants of that market."	"Brian Spratley"	"4"

With all the medical lawsuits that are going on and are allowed to go on, I would rather work where I have been accepted as a competant worker and not as a risk. I am a survivor because, a small country like Danmark let me move there and finish school and helped me with my education until I was 23, I then worked hard at a factoring company owned by a group of Danish banks, There I worked AR and saw something that needed improvement and told my dept.leader, who tried to take credit for it, but I went straight to th president of the company and I was put in charge of  improving the customer lists and consistant sorting of accounts, It gave me enough to buy me an apartment and later move back to the USA.

"negative"	"I'm a 38 year old chemical engineering student, mom to the two most perfect and amazing Korat cats, a pretty loving girlfriend, and I have epilepsy. I have the pleasure of only having grand mal seizures, no variety. My first happened completely out of the blue in 2004, and I injured myself pretty badly. They always last at least ten minutes and have been getting longer with each successive one. I have had 14 concussions, broken my nose twice, dislocated both shoulders, broken one wrist so badly that it required surgery, and numerous painful bruises and cuts. I'm blessed that I have an aura of about 1-2 seconds, so a couple of times I've been able to prevent injury from the seizure by getting to the floor, and the one time I had one while driving, I was able to pull over to safety beforehand. Epilepsy has taken a lot from me: my career as a transit driver in Minneapolis, my ability to play video games, seeing live concerts, this intangible and unexplainable feeling of safety and well-being. You never know when or where you'll be when the next one happens, and uncertainty causes stress for me, and stress increases the frequency of the seizures and intensifies the chronic pain I have from the injuries sustained during seizures. Thankfully, I've found a combination of medications that control my seizures really well; I used to have them every few weeks and now I'm approaching my second year free of seizures. They're very expensive: even as generics, the monthly cash price is more than $500. I hate that I have to depend on money from the government (in the form of an insurance subsidy) to be able to buy my medications, I took great pride in being a self-sufficient, tax-paying, productive citizen, and now I'm dependent. I'm afraid that my hard work in engineering school will be a waste, because what if I have a seizure and I'm working in a chemical plant? I've been fortunate and have always lived where doctors are not required to report seizures to the DMV, so I've never lost my license, but will I be legally able to work in the settings that a chemical engineer would work in?

At their ages you can feel them slipping away into adulthood and it is hard sometimes, there will never be enough time in the world to spend with them.  We are total animal lovers with three dogs, one cat, and sixteen birds!!  They are all an extension of our family; some talk, some play, some cuddle, and some have truly been a comfort to me.  I love helping others and felt I had found a my true calling in the medical office field, even got my BA in Health Care Administration with a GPA I never expected out of myself :-)  My life changed early January 2010 when I had my first grand-mal ever at the age of 32.  Even though I tried so hard not to I lost my job, I lost the independence of driving myself around, and I started to swirl down the rabbit hole of depression.  I still am not medically released to return to work or drive, but I mentally fight allowing epilepsy to define me everyday.  Honestly, it has made me look for my own self worth in places other than work, it has made me appreciate everyday I wake up and don't have my husband stairing scaredly in my eyes, and it has made me more aware of every blessing I am given.

But I have seizures OFTEN,,,,usually just the smaller seizures.....I don't have but the grand mals but about once a month if that often,  But the absence seizures....I may have several a day if there are high pressure systems....but If I am around that dog....he seems to sense it....he will just sometimes stare at me and stay close to me.....like he has to protect me.....its strange.  Didn't know if it was my imagination.....or if it was possible????? without training?  Perhaps he has just been with us long enough that he can just tell I am sickly those days because it does make me very weak.  Just curious....  But he seems to know it BEFORE they start is the weird thing....BEFORE I do oftentimes.....

I'm on three right now.  I've had the VNS since September of 2012, and things just seem to be getting worse with my condition. Whenever I would have a seizure, and the magnet for the VNS would be used, 90% of the time it doesn't work.  The thing I hate most about my condition is that I NEVER know when the seizures are coming on. , I've been on permanent disability since 2010 for my condition, got approved for SSD 2 months later, and just started my full SSD this month.  I had a horrible car accident 4 years ago due to a seizure, & DMV said I'd never be able to drive again, even if I'm seizure free for a year.   It seems that I've lost my best friend, and a lot of friends besides her, b/c I can't drive, and they don't want to take the time to drive a measly 10-15 to come to my house.

My seizures suddenly started for no reason when I was 28, and I was a full-time city bus driver. I lived alone and owned my home, I needed my job! I realize now how irresponsible this was, but I kept working (driving) until 2006, when I came clean with my employer. I was hoping to be able to get a different job within the company, but it wasn't so. That's been the only real job I've had, I was there for over ten years. So, I'm having to retrain myself for a whole new career…  but that means going to engineeing school, and an 86 mile one-way commute. Thankfully, I've been seizure-free since January 19, 2013 and my meds keep them controlled, to the point where if I stopped taking my meds, I could predict the next seizure to within hours. I live in New Orleans, in a suburban area with poor bus service, yet it's still too dangerous to be out as a single female. I have a 1-2 second aura before the seizures start, and that has saved me from injuries more than a few times. I'm terrified of what may happen, I know that I won't likely live out my life seizure-free, but I don't know how I'd get anywhere if I can't drive, since my support system is virtually nonexistent."

Anything your angry about gets released into your health and it helps me by putting that stress somewhere healthy and more focused. It also helps me narrow my focus on the situation instead of being overwhelmed by the problem."	"Gehvyn Gabrielle Kauimeleokalani Stream"	"4"
"positive"	"No yoga or tai chi but especially in the winter months I join exercise groups at the local Y. Spin class can be a great calorie burner and stress relief. In warmer months I personally prefer to be outdoors so I focus on bicycling, running and kayaking. Choose an exercise you enjoy and is safe for your personal situation. Consult a doctor first if you have not been exercising. Any exercise is a great stress relief and will improve your health."	"Bryan Griffin"	"2"
"positive"	"Definitely yes and I echo what everyone else has suggested since stress can be a major trigger. Exercise, yoga, tai chi all help to maintain healthy oxygenated blood to your brain, centers you spiritually and psychologically,  and diverts your energy and fears away from our conditions.  My only additional suggestion would to be sure to wear or place an order to have some sort of medical alert bracelet or necklace which states your condition with access to additional important information regarding meds, emergency contacts and phone numbers including MD names in case something should happen during. This way not only are you doing something beneficial to improve your mind and body,  but gives you the additional protection of safety should you be out in the gym or running/walking in the community."

"negative"	"If your seizures aren't 100% controlled, DO NOT DRIVE!!!  A relative of mine who is a fire fighter and paramedic, has made runs to multiple auto accidents, where a person with epilepsy, who's seizures were not fully controlled, ended up severely injured or dead, and severely injured or killed someone else in the process.  He's even seen some of the people with epilepsy arrested, because they were driving without a license, caused an accident while having a seizure, but were not injured, though the driver/passenger/s in the other vehicle was/were.  IT'S    A G A I N S T   THE LAW!!!  Don't take the chance of ruining/ending your life or the lives of others.  Sadly, I'm speaking from personal experience.  I was one of the ones with seizures that were not 100% controlled, who continued to drive at the expense of someone else's health and welfare.  Thankfully - that's hard for me to say - when my neurologist found out I was still driving, he made me surrender my license to the highway patrol.  He even checked with them to make sure I had.  I haven't driven since 1989, I live in one of the top ten largest cities in the country, but with public transportation, help from friends and family, and good old healthy walking, I can get anywhere I want/need to go."

"negative"	"I, so, agree with Tim....I obtained my driver's license in 1975, & had no driving issues until 2005.

One morning I left home to run errands, only to have a seizure while driving, & found myself submerged in a body of water. I was lucky. God wasn't ready for me, yet! And, yes, I did not drive, again, until my seizures were under control. Since I lived in a mid-sized community, with limited epilepsy expertise, I relocated to a large metropolitan area, & now have a superb epileptologist.  Until my seizures were under control, I learned to use the train & bus systems. Plus, I've always been an avid walker. Today I am driving, and plan on returning to my hometown within the next 2 weeks. I will continue to see my epileptologist --- 200 miles away.

I had one neurologist back in 1981 who suggested that it may have been caused by a possible stroke during birth.  Fast-forward technology about 30 years later, and my current neurologist disagrees with that prognosis.  Saying that a stroke typically leaves scar tissue behind.

"negative"	"I have been diagnosed with epilepsy for 7 years now, but my neurologist says I have probably had it all my life just hadn't recognized the sign til it progressively got worse with age and not being medicated til now. See when in grade school my teachers would say that I would day dream alot and wouldn't pay attention in class,  but my doctor now thinks I could have been miss diagnosed back then when really I could have been having absence seizures all along.  I still do have many absence seizures a day along with my partial complex ones. 
But I too through the years have learnt to control my seizures,  and tell my brain to basically to take the seizure away with out having to go through all the whole episode of having a full fledge attack and get embarrassed because people don't understand what's going on,  nor know how to help. 

Which I find is hard sometimes now that I have gone back to college.  I try to keep my epilepsy to myself because I am scared of judgment that was so tough for me when I was in high school.  :-("	"Airianna Mae Culp"	"2"

"positive"	"I have someone who takes me to all of my drs. appt. and I tild this family member that from now on STAY IN THE DABBLASTED WAITING ROOM!  THIS IS MY DRS. APPTS. ABOUT ME, NOT YOU!  I DON'T NEED YOU INTERRUPTING ME,  TO TALK ABOUT YOUR HEALTH! AND ADDING BITS AND PIECES ABOUT THINGS YOU HAVE NO IDEA ABOUT, ESPECIALLY SINCE YOU DO NOT EVEN LIVE WITH ME!!!!!!!!
After I told my father off he not permitted in any drs. appts., nor any drs. treatments, physical therapy or anything dealing with ANY DRS. that talk to me. Even if it is in th ER. I TOLD HIM, IF THAT HURTS YOUR FEELINGS, I'M JUST EXPRESSING HOW I FEEL, AND HOW SOME DRS. HAVE  EXPRESSED TO ME, WHILE  YOU ARE BEING THE ROOM DURING MY TREATMENTS.  YOU ARE DISRUPTING THEM, AND CAUSING THEM TO CUT MY TIME IF WHAT THEY NEED TO ASK,  OR DO! 
SO.......after that nice little conversation,  he waits I the waiting room, or if something happens, and he is needed,  then he is allowed. He is not permitted to even read what I may have to sign, nor is he permitted to speak on my behave if we are in the ER, and I can't speak, like when I had my Stroke in 2012. I tried to sign, but it was hard since I was paralysed on one side of my body, but it was just my left side,  but I did what I could with my right. Once my brother came to the ER,  he was able to translate, since I taught him when he was younger, and he still remembered,  and he sometimes has to use it for his job, and he knows my body language, considering he lives with me. So he, and my mother know my body language without me saying a word, since I do live with my Mother.  She works, since I am disabled with a lot of things, while my father is, I guess disabled, but he doesn't work, so that's my transportation. That is also, I hope answers your question, EPILEPSY ADVOCATE.......anything else, you can send it to me by way of  message.

A person can die in a seizure. That's a fact. Seizure activity, as our captain says, is nothing to clown around about.
I get tired of people doing that. I'm not a saint. I'm an Emergency Medical Technician at the Paramedic level.
I wish there were more classes that explain how serious seizure activity really is. Sometimes, I think some people NEED to feel the import behind the words.

The medication coming in a 90 day supply is cheaper than going month to month through a local pharmacy.  I also use my flexible spending account to pay for all her medications that many do no take advantage of through their jobs.  As soon as the 90 day prescription arrives I send in the reorder form and they auto fill it on the first day it is eligible to fill.

Blanking out for a few seconds during a conversation, staring off into space, or certain odd uncontrollable body movements.  With these seizures I have found people aren't as supportive or understanding.  I don't have issues with people that do not know me.  What I have issues with and what really stings are the friends and family that do know.  Many make snide, low brow comments like ""look at me when I'm talking to you,"" snapping their fingers in you face, treating you like an idiot, rolling their eyes when you talk or just plain being mean and rude.

I never called in sick unless I had to go to the ER because I couldn't function without having a seizure.  Finally I went to a new dr. earlier this year and was introduced to something called VNS.  I had this implant put in back in March.  It has made a tremendous difference in my quality of life!  I can actually go to sleep and not be so concerned about having horrible seizures in my sleep or wake up having them.  I'm not cured, but I definitely have a better quality of life!

I worry cause before Jan 28, 2010 I had a happy go lucky 7 year old who didn't have a care in the world.

Everything I have seen is for dogs already in the programs. Just a few months before my brother's first seizure I got him an akc yellow lab, he went two years before his last seizure a few months back and Bailey (the dog)  sat in front of my brother and started to stare at him minutes before the seizure came on.  If he can sense these things and we can teach him how to hone in on that and let someone know when they happen since my brother lives in an upstairs apartment alone would be great. Any ideas?"

Very little was known about epilepsy then (1953) and a little later my folks were told they should put me in an - insane is not the word but close to it - asylum.   I will be forever grateful they didn't and treated me the same as they did my brother and sister.   I was on cross country team in HS.    I have 2 associates degrees and have had a full life.

"negative"	"My daughter began experiencing seizures at 3 months old. Nobody believed me, at first, that anything was going on because they were so short and infrequent. I knew. I just knew.For years I dealt with it without any kind of diagnosis and everyone thinking I was being overly cautious and making a big deal out of nothing. She started preschool and the teacher would send home discipline notes every day about how she wouldn't listen. How she spent too much time daydreaming. About how she was defiant and would sit and stare at her desk instead of lining up with the other kids.. I told them what I had suspected since she was an infant. They didn't believe me. I told her doctor. She said ""Sometimes kids just daydream..""  At seven, she complained on New Years Day of a headache.. Then, her seizure started. I drove through a blizzard to get her to the emergency room and the seizure was still taking place. They finally believed me. She is now 8. Her seizures are for the most part under control. She's beginning hippotherapy this week.

My doctors still weren't satisfied. I was on large amounts of medications.  On march 17,2008 my doctors put in a NVS Vagus Nerve Stimulator. Since I had the implant put in I haven't had any seizures. They were also. Able to cut back on my medications.
